# Earths Movement in relation to Time           
The earths movement around the sun gives us years. A year is when the earth completely orbits the sun, comi0ng back to where it started.

The earths movement around its axis gives us days. A day is equivalent to the earth completing one spin on its axis.

The earths movement around the sun and its natural tilt gives us seasons. This is because that earth would appear at different distances to the sun because of the tilt.
