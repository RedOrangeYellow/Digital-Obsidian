[[ðŸŒŒ Our Solar System]]
# Effects of a Meteorite Impact
### Earth
At the center of the impact, would be a large crater. Nearly 800,000 years ago, an asteroid with the diameter of 1 kilometre. However, our ancestors had survived this, therefore proving that asteroids that size would not be a threat. However, asteroids larger than that would cause server problems.

The amount of kinetic [[Energy Forms|Kinetic Energy]] released upon impact would be equivalent to the simultaneous of billions of atomic bombs. Earthquakes, firestorms, and tsunamis would be all present for some time after the initial strike.

Smoke and dust would quickly fill the sky, blocking out any [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] coming from distant stars or the sun, causing the extinction of many wildlife [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] and animals, known as an impact winter.

However, long term survive is possible, with technology advancing, people could live their lives underground, with the chance to rebuild civilization.
