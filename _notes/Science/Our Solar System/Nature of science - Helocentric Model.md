# Nature of Science: Heliocentric Model
The nature of Science: Science is tentative. This means that Science develops overtime, with new theories or ideas becoming accepted, replacing the old [[Theory]] due to improvement in society and technology.

For example, the development of the heliocentric model had taken a long time to complete, and is still changing, with the latest change being Pluto being removed from the solar system because it was a dwarf planet.

### Timeline
1. Great minds like Aristotle and Ptolemy supported the idea that the earth was the center of the universe, also known as the Geocentric model. They had come to this conclusion since the stars had seemed to be moving around them at night, and when throwing a ball up into the air, it landed back down in the same spot it was thrown.
2. Then in 1543, Copernicus proposed on the revolution of the Celestial spheres, where he explained that the sun was at the center of the universe and we, along with the other planets, moved around the sun. This is the birth of the heliocentric model. He had said each orbit of the planets where a circle that revolved around the sun.
3. Galileo Galilei had discovered the moons of Jupiter and had understand that smaller objects revolved around the larger ones.
4. Johannes Kepler suggested that the orbits of planets were not perfect circles â€“ but ellipses of different sizes, and sped up when closer to the sun, and slower when further away from the sun.
5. Sir Isaac Newton proposed his laws of motion and explained the force that drove the planets around the sun as gravity.
