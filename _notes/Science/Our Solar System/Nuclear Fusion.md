# Nuclear Fusion
Nuclear Fusion occurs when two Light nuclei merge to form a single heavier nucleus, and releasing [[âš¡ Energy]] as a product. Inside the sun, this can be found when two [[Hydrogen]] nuclei merges to form a single helium nucleus. By fusing [[Hydrogen]] atoms together into helium and other heavier elements, it releases huge amounts of [[âš¡ Energy]], which is in the form of [[Energy Forms| light and heat]].
