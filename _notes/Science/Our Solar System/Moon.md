[[ðŸŒŒ Our Solar System]]
# Moon
The Moon is a celestial body that [[Rotation - Moons, Planets, Stars|orbits]] around a planet. It is called a [[Natural Satellite]]. The moon has [[Energy Forms|Gravitational Energy]] strong enough to causes [[Spring and Neap Tides|changes in tides]], but not enough to impact daily life.

The moon has different phases. This is because the [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] that has been [[Reflection|Reflected]] off the moon is different at any given moment, meaning that the moon could be fully illuminated, or not visible at all. These phases are commonly known as:

1. New moon
2. Waxing crescent
3. First quarter
4. Waxing gibbous
5. Full moon
6. Waning gibbous
7. Third quarter
8. Waning crescent
