[[Moon]]
# Spring and Neap Tides
The [[Moon]] causes ocean tides because the [[Moon]] also emits its own gravitational field. The water in the ocean is drawn to it.

### Neap Tides
Neap tides are when the tides are unusually deep.This is because the gravitational forces of the [[Moon]] and the sun are acting against each other. Neap tides are commonly found during a new or full [[Moon]].

### Spring Tides
Neap tides are when the tides are unusually shallow. This is because the gravitational forces of the [[Moon]] and the sun are acting together to enhance the amount of gravitational force exceeded.
Spring tides are commonly found during a new or full [[Moon]], when the [[Moon]] and sun are aligned at any given moment.
