[[ðŸŒŒ Our Solar System]]
# Why Earth Can Support Life           
1. Temperature â€“ to the sun is neither too close nor too far, meaning the temperature is not extremely hot or cold, allowing life to form.
2. Plate tectonics â€“ system of plate tectonics that enables the carbon-silicate that regulates temperature.
	1. Water â€“ water is regularly available and carries minerals and life to new places.
3. Atmosphere â€“ the atmosphere traps heat, and shields the surface from harmful [[Radiation]], and provides chemicals needed for life, such as nitrogen and [[Carbon Dioxide]].
4. Right size â€“ the earth is large enough to hang onto its own atmosphere, but not so large to hold to too much atmosphere and consequently too much heat because of it.
5. Big brother â€“ Jupiter is earths big brother. It has a large gravitational force which helps divert and vacuum up incoming asteroids or other potential life-threatening events to occur.
6. [[âš¡ Energy]] â€“ with a steady input of either [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] or chemical [[âš¡ Energy]], cells can run chemical reactions needed.
7. Nutrients â€“ all [[Solid]] planets and moons have the same general chemical makeup, so nutrients are present. Those with a water cycle or volcanic activity can allow the nutrients to be transported around the planet.
8. Magnetic field â€“ the magnetic field serves to deflect most solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip the ozone layer that protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet [[Radiation]].
9. [[Moon]] â€“ the moons stabilizing effect on our planetary rotation, which prevents the poles from facing the sun, resulting in dramatic climate changes.
