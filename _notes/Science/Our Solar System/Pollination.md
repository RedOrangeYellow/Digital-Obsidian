# Pollination
Pollination is the [[Plant]] equivalent of fertilization. This is when a [[Plant]] produces a seed. There are two types of pollination: [[Self-Polination]] and [[Cross-Pollination]].
This is further split into two categories - [[Wind-Pollination|Wind-Pollinatied]] and [[Insect-Pollination | Insect-Pollinated]].

Pollination is important as it determines the survival of the [[Plant]] and its species. After pollination, [[Germination]] takes place.
