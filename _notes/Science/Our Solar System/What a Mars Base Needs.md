# What a Mars Base needs
### [[âš¡ Energy]]
Solar power is not enough. Mars is further away from the sun, and it is usually blocked out by dust storms at days on end. This would not allow the colonists to generate enough [[âš¡ Energy]].

Geothermal power is not enough. Mars' core is to cold, therefore geothermal [[âš¡ Energy]] can only be extracted very close to the core, which is much too difficult for a colonization attempt.

Wind power is not enough. There is hardly any atmosphere, therefore wind would be "non-existent".
However, Nuclear [[âš¡ Energy]] is easy to carry and is much easier and constant in giving power. This can easily be done through a reactor and fuel bought by spacecrafts in future missions for restocks â€“ powering the first few outposts for a few years.

### Air
Humans need [[Oxygen]] to survive, and Mars' atmosphere is 1% as dense as Earth's, and mostly comprised of [[Carbon Dioxide]]. The outposts need to be pressurized with an artificial atmosphere comprised of nitrogen and [[Oxygen]] in the same ratio as it is on earth.

### Outposts
Corners and flat walls are all weak points. Due to the never-ending release of "artificial atmosphere" into the outposts, it would soon start cramming if the flow of atmosphere is stopped. To prevent leakage and tearing, round corners and smooth walls would be needed to resist the pressure.

The airlocks would need to be very airtight and reliable to 100%. This is because the atmosphere on Mars is deadly to humans. Mars does not have an extensive magnetosphere, or a dense atmosphere, half of all radiation coming from space will reach the ground. A person on Mars would experience 50 times more radiation than they would on earth, causing cancer risks to heighten.

Because of this, CO2 can be used from the atmosphere to create a shield that reflects this radiation and can be forced upon the outpost. Further to s further increase the safety, covering the dry ice with dirt would also provide protection.

### Scouting and exploration
The outside is too dangerous for a person. Therefore, drones and robots would be used for routine work on the surface, and the crew controls them from the safety of the outpost.

Mars dust can also be forced into the gears and electronics of the machines, causing them to break down. Mars dust is also very dry, causing it to be electro-statically charged, meaning it would stick to spacesuits without a mean to get it off. That would mean that one would be breathing in the dangerous dust inside the outpost, and would soon fall ill because of its toxic compounds, the perchlorate salts.

However, this could be avoided if the spacesuit would never enter the outposts, and instead stay outside it in such a way.

### Food and water
Water can be found under the polar caps of Mars; therefore, a pump and a few pipes would be easy to set up.

Mars' soil is very alkaline, and lack the nitrogen to grow food, so decontamination of the soil would be a key process to growing food but is difficult and expensive.

Soil can be fertilized using biological waste, but is very [[âš¡ Energy]] intensive, so the use of an aquaponics (raise fish and [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] in a controlled ecosystem) could be used.

This would allow the food served to be varied and healthy at the same time

### Wellbeing of the crew.
Repeating the same task over and over is very detrimental to one's mental health. However, with the various foods, and use of role swapping, this could proven to become a small challenge.

However, Mars has 38% of earth's surface gravity, therefore causing muscle-wasting, bone loss, and cardiovascular problems. The crew would have to exercise intensively to combat this.

Rotation of crews on an outpost site might also help with their wellbeing, especially if a member has died.
