[[ðŸŒŒ Our Solar System]]
# Rotation - Moons, Planets, Stars
### Stars
A star, such as the sun, is in the centre of the solar system. The star rotates around its own axis.
### Planets
A planet, being smaller than the star, therefore having less gravitational force, is orbiting the star, with the star as the orbits centre point. Furthermore, the planet is also rotating on its axis.
### Moons
c. A [[Moon]], like a planet, is smaller than a planet, therefore orbiting the planet whilst it rotates on its own axis.
