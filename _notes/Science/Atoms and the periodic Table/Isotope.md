[[⚛️ Atom]]
# Isotopes
An isotope is an [[Element]] with a different [[Atomic Mass]]. This occurs because the [[Element]] has a different about of neutrons bound. Different [[Element]]s have a different amount of isotopes, but generally speaking, the bigger the [[⚛️ Atom]], the more isotopes it should have.
