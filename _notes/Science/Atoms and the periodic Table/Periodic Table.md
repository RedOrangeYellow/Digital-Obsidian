[[⚛️ Atom]]
# The Periodic Table
The Periodic Table was created to sort the known [[Element]], and it manged to predict many undiscovered atoms. Each Cell in the periodic table refers to an [[Element]]. The Cell contains the [[Element]] symbol, the full name of the [[Element]], the [[Atomic Number]], and the [[Atomic Mass]].

### Where things are found
The Periodic Table is split into periods and groups, with periods being horizontal (going across), and Groups going vertically (going up and downwards), in reference to the cells.

- Metals
	- Found in the **left-hand side** of the Periodic table.
	- High melting points, **good [[Conductors]] of electricity, good [[Conductors]] of heat**, high density, malleable, ductile.
- Non-metal
	- Found on the **right-hand side** of the Periodic table, except for [[Hydrogen]].
	- Non-lustrous, various colors, brittle, hard or soft, **poor [[Conductors]] of heat**, **poor [[Conductors]] of electricity**, non-metallic oxides are **acidic, covalent**.
- Metalloids
	-** In between** the metals and non-metals
	- Metalloids usually look like metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are **shiny, brittle solids** with intermediate to **relatively good electrical conductivity** and the electronic band structure of a semi-metal or semiconductor.

### The States of [[Matter]] in the Periodic Table
1. All metals and Metalloids are solids at room temperature, except for mercury.
2. Boron, carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine are [[Solid]] non-metals at room temperature.
3. Rest of the non-metals are gasses at room temperature.

### Trends in the Periodic Table
- Group 1 – **Alkali metals**
	- They all react with water to produce an alkaline solution.
- Group 7 – **Halogens**
	- They are reactive non-metals.
	- Chlorine Green gas Sterilizing water.
- Group 8 – **Noble Gases**
	- They do not need to bond with other molecules because of its full valence shell, because the [[⚛️ Atom]] is already stable by itself.
