[[Matter]]
#  Solid
Solids are one of the four common states of [[Matter]]. The [[Molecule]]s that make up a solid are packed tightly together, and do possess much kinetic [[âš¡ Energy]], but the molecules can vibrate slightly. Unlike a [[Liquid]], the object does not flow to take the shape of a container, nor does it expand to fill the container, like a [[ðŸ’¨ Gases]]. A solid as a definite shape and a definite size. However, solids can be compressed. Solids are harder to compress compared to [[ðŸ’¨ Gases]], but easier to compress compared to [[Liquid]].
