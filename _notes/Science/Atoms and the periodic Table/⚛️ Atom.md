# Atoms and the [[Periodic Table]]
### What is an Atom?
An atom is the smallest building block of [[Matter]] and is indivisible. The word comes from the Greek word, a- **(not)** and temnein **(to cut)** to form atomos **(indivisible)**. All [[Matter]] ([[Solid]], [[Liquid]], gas, and [[Plasma]]) is of [[Neutral or Iodized Atoms]]. 

An atom consists of of three [[Sub Particles]], and its 99.94% of its entire [[Mass]] is found in the nucleus. Atoms are sorted in a [[Periodic Table]], something that Dmitri Mendeleev had created in the year **1869**.

When an atom is chemically joined with another, or more, it is no longer an atom, but a [[Molecule]]. Atoms of the same form are what we call [[element]]s. We represent an atom through the use of a [[Bohr Model]]. 
### History of the Atom 
First, there was the idea of cutting down a material until it could not be cut anymore. Leucippus of Miletus named this, a building block of [[Matter]], Atomos, meaning "indivisible". This is around **500 B.C.E** in Greece. This is from **Democritus**.

 In **1808**, **John Dalton**. He had shown that common substances always broke down into the same substances in the same proportions. Various compounds were a combination of atoms of different [[Element]], each of a particular size and [[Mass]] that could neither be created nor destroyed.

**J.J. Thompson** in **1897** had discovered the electron. Plum diagram was created. He suggested that atoms were a plum, where the plum was positively charged with negatively charged electrons scattered about.

**Ernest Rutherford** proved that the atom is made of empty space, with most of the [[Matter]] clumped in the middle with electrons surrounding it. He had been able to pass alpha particles through a thin sheet of gold, hence proving that atoms were mostly comprised of empty space. This discovery was made in the year **1911**.

**Niels Bohr** in **1913** and expanded on Rutherford's work by drawing ideas from Max Planck, he had implied that the atom's electrons orbited the nucleus at fixed energies and distances and was able to jump from one fixed [[âš¡ Energy]] shell to another, but not in between called the planetary model.
