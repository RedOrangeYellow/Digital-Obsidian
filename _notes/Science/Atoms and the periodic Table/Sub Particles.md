[[⚛️ Atom]]
# Sub Particles of an [[⚛️ Atom]]
There are three components of the [[⚛️ Atom]]: the nucleus, the protons, and the neutrons. They each have different charges, +-0, +1, -1, respectively. The protons and the neutrons sit inside the nucleus of the [[⚛️ Atom]], with the electrons siting outside it. (Refer to diagram underneath)

The [[Atomic Number]] and [[Atomic Mass]] can be used to find the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons. From the [[Atomic Number]], we can conclude the number of protons and electrons. Through the [[Atomic Mass]], we can conclude how [[Sub Particles]] there are.  This means we can find the number of neutrons.

*P = [[Atomic Number]]*
*E = [[Atomic Number]]*
*M = [[Atomic Mass]]*

*N = Number of Neutrons*
**N = M - P or N = M - E**
