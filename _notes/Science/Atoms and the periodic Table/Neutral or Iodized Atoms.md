[[⚛️ Atom]]
# Neutral or Iodized Atoms
Atoms are neutral; they contain the same number of protons (+1 Charge) and electrons (-1 Charge). These [[Sub Particles]] cancel each other out. However, with ions, they are either missing one electron, or contain an extra electron. This forces the net charge to shift to either positive or negative. The number of electrons that are excess or missing change the total charge.
