### What is a Gas?
*The [[Hindenburg Disaster]] was a historical accident that led to the end of large corporations*

A gas is one of the four fundamental states of [[Matter]]. A gas is mostly always [[mixture]], and never an [[element]]. A gas has neither a stable volume, but a volume that is ever changing, as well as not having a stable shape, always expanding. The particles are bursting with kinetic [[⚡ Energy]], and move at high speeds and rarely pass another [[⚛️ Atom]]. 

Gases have different [[Physical Properties]] and [[Chemical Properities]] that make each one unique. The [[Air]] we breath is a [[Mixture]] of different gases. 

[[Hydrogen]] has many different properties, and so does [[Oxygen]]. [[Carbon Dioxide]] is useful in keeping the world warm, and [[Nitrogen]] is the most abundant gas in the world. 

The [[Rate of Reaction]] can be useful when conducting experiments using gases. Gases can also be used in a variety of [[Explosives]].
