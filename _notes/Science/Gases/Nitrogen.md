# Nitrogen
Nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and a diatomic gas at slandered environments. Nitrogen is found in 78% of the earths atmosphere and [[Air]]. Nitrogen is volatile in most its forms. It is unreactive to the materials that makes up solid earth, and is very stable against solar radiation.

Nitrogen, in comparison to [[Oxygen]], is four times more abundant in the atmosphere. Being unreactive to the materials that make up solid earth means that nitrogen is wasted into reactions with the ground, which is every where. Being stable against solar radiation also allows the gas to exist in more places that oxygen is.

### Uses of Nitrogen
Nitrogen is used in the chemical industry to produce fertilizers, nitric acid, nylon, dyes, and explosives.

Nitrogen is needed by living things to produce amino acids, proteins, and DNA. Nitrogen is also needed to create the chlorophyll inside chloroplasts.

Nitrogen reacts with [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] to create ammonia. $H_2 + N_2 -> NH_3$. 

### The Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen, like the [[Carbon Cycle]], also has a [[Nitrogen Cycle|Cycle]].
