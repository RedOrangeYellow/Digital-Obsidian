# Fire
### What causes a fire and how do we put it out?
A fire needs three things to surface and survive. Theses things are known as [[Oxygen]], fuel, and heat. 

Without one of these, the fire would cease. This is why firefighters recommend sand and water. When one pours sand over a fire, there is no [[Oxygen]] able to reach the fire, therefore the fire is put out. With water, the heat would be removed as the [[Energy Forms|heat energy]] would have to be spread evenly, therefore lowering the heat levels of the fire.
