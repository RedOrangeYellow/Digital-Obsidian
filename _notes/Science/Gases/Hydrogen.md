# Hydrogen Gas
Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas under normal conditions on Earth. It typically exists as a diatomic molecule, meaning each molecule has two atoms of hydrogen; this is why pure hydrogen is commonly expressed as $H_2$.


### Properties
Hydrogen is the most abundant element on earth as it accounts for 90% of the universe by weight.

Hydrogen is easy to chemically combine with other elements. Hydrogen is combined with [[Oxygen]] to create water.

Hydrogen is easily flammable, which is the causer for the [[Hindenburg Disaster]].

Hydrogen is [[Combustion|combustible]]. The equation is as follows:
**$2H_2(g) + 0_2(g) -> 2H_2O(g)$**
The equation take 2 hydrogen molecules and an [[Oxygen]] molecule to react to form water vapor and also releases [[âš¡ Energy]] in the forms of [[Energy Forms|Light]] and [[Energy Forms|Heat]].

### Test
Testing for hydrogen gas is done through an easy test called the pop test.
 - Light a splint on fire, and push it near the substance you wanted to test. 
 - If the result is a loud pop, there is hydrogen.
 - The pop is the hydrogen [[Combustion|combusting]] with the [[Oxygen]] as there is a fuel source.
