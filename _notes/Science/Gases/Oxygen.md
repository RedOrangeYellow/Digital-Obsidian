[[ðŸ’¨ Gases]]
# Oxygen
Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless [[ðŸ’¨ Gases|gas]] that is essential of living creaters to [[Breathing|breathe]] for [[Cellular Respiration]]. It is further a byproduct of [[Photosynthesis]]. Oxygen can be further made into a [[Compound]] by basically any element due to its [[Combustion]] property.

### Reactions involving Oxygen
Oxygen causes rusting: $O_2 + Fe + H_2O -> Fe_2O_2H_2O$. *Oxygen + Iron + Water = Rust*

Oxygen is a result of [[Photosynthesis]]: $6CO_2 +6H_2O -> C_6H_12O_6 + 6O_2$.
*[[Carbon Dioxide]] + Water -> Sugar + Oxygen*

Oxygen causes respiration: $C_6H_12O_6 + 6O_2 â†’ 6CO_2 + 6H_2O$. *[[Glucose]] + [[Oxygen]] -> [[Carbon Dioxide]] + Water + ATP*

### Testing for oxygen
Oxygen, like [[Hydrogen]] can be tested through the pop test. 
 - Testing for [[Hydrogen]] gas is done through an easy test called the pop test.
 - Light a splint on fire, and push it near the substance you wanted to test. 
 - If the result is a loud pop, there is [[Hydrogen]].
 - The pop is the oxygen [[Combustion|combusting]]
