[[Rate of Reaction]]
# Collision Theory
The collision [[Theory]] is grounded by the assumption that for a reaction to occur, there must be collision between the atoms of the reactants. 

However, not all collisions bring chemical change. A collision will only bring chemical change when the atoms that collide contain a certain amount of energy.

This explains why collision theory indeed measure the rate of reaction. It measures the amount of successful chemical collisions there are per second. This is only accurate, however, to [[ðŸ’¨ Gases]].

*This [[Theory]] is only limited to [[ðŸ’¨ Gases]]*
