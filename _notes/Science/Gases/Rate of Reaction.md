# Rate of Reaction
The rate of reaction is how fast a reaction can take place. Scientist often use the [[Collision Theory]] to predict the rate of reaction.

### Rate of Reaction for [[ðŸŒ± Plants]]
The rate of reaction for [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] can vary greatly. The [[Photosynthesis|Equation]] requires both [[Carbon Dioxide]] and water, as they are the reactants to produce glucose and [[Oxygen]] in the presence of [[ðŸ’¡ Light]]. When a decrease of [[Carbon Dioxide]], water, or [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] occurs, the rate of reaction also decreases as there are less opportunities for the reactions to take place. Therefore, the products would also significantly decrease if there was a significant decrease in the reactants.
