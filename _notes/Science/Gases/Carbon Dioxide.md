# Carbon Dioxide 
Carbon Dioxide is a [[Compound]] made of two [[Oxygen]] atoms and Carbon atom.

Carbon Dioxide is important as it is found in the air to prevent the world from loosing its temperature, as well as playing a key role in the [[Carbon Cycle]].

### Uses of Carbon Dioxide
Humans use carbon dioxide in their drinks to create a bubbling effect. Carbon dioxide is also used to put out [[Fire|fires]] by removing the source of oxygen as carbon dioxide has more atoms, therefore heavier, and the oxygen would rise above the oxygen, therefore cutting off supply of oxygen.

### Reactions involving Carbon Dioxide
Carbon Dioxide is needed for [[Photosynthesis]] to occur: $6CO_2 +6H_2O -> C_6H_12O_6 + 6O_2$. *[[Carbon Dioxide]] + Water -> Sugar + Oxygen*

Carbon Dioxide can change the pH of water: $CO_2 + H_2O --> H_2CO_3$
*Carbon Dioxide + Water -> Carbonic acid*

Carbon Dioxide is created when hydroclohric acid and calcium carbonate. 
$CaCO_3(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> CaCl_2(aq) + CO_2(g) + H_2O(l)$
*calcium carbonate + hydrochloric acid -> calcium chloride + water + carbon dioxide*

### Making Carbon Dioxide 
Carbon Dioxide is produced whenever an acid reacts with a carbonate.

### Testing for Carbon Dioxide
Carbon Dioxide can turn limewater cloudy when pumped through it.
 - Have a beaker of limewater
 - Have a reaction take place that produces carbon dioxide or a pump that pushes carbon dioxide into a specific are.
 - Lead the carbon dioxide to the limewater , and have it pump through the limewater.
 - If the limewater becomes cloudy, there is carbon dioxide present.
