# Hindenburg Disasters
The Hindenburg Disaster is an incident involving a large airship that caught [[Fire]] while trying to land. 

### What caused the fire?
At first, the airships were filled with helium gas, a non-flammable gas. However, since the US had placed restrictions on the exportation of the gas, the company had switched to the use of [[Hydrogen]], is a flammable gas, with a lower ignition energy to set it on [[Fire]], making it easier to set on [[Fire]] than other gases. 

The [[Fire]] had been a result of a "discharge of atmospheric electricity" (Lightning Strike) near a gas leak on the ship's surface, which supplemented all the three things for a [[Fire]].
