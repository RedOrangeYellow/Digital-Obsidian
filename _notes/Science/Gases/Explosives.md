# Explosives
An explosion is a quick release of large amounts of [[Energy Forms]] during a chemical reaction. [[Hydrogen]] is easily flammable, and [[Nitrogen|Nitrates]] can be used to form explosives.

### TNT
TNT is made up of carbon, [[Oxygen]], and [[Nitrogen]]. When TNT explodes, it forms several stable gases, Carbon Monoxide, [[Carbon Dioxide]], and [[Nitrogen]]. The production of these very low energy bonds that are stable means that a great deal of energy is released.

### Gas Explosions
Gas explosions often occur when there is a fuel leak in the presence of a spark or flame. The fuel is most commonly natural gas, methane, propane, or butane.
