[[Carbon Dioxide]]
# Carbon Cycle 
The carbon cycle is the nature's way of recycling carbon atoms, as it is the foundation of life on earth.

Carbon forms the key molecules for life, such as the DNA and Protein. The cycle is the carbon atoms released into the atmosphere and then becoming a living organism, which in turn release it back into the atmosphere. 

### Release into the atmosphere
 - Rocks and sentiments are the most abundant source of carbon.
 - However, the ocean contains most of the carbon. The ocean is a giant carbon sink that absorbs carbon.
 - Dead animals become fossil fuels, therefore becoming combustible, which leads to the emission of carbon dioxide.
 - Plants and other living animals also give off carbon emissions through [[Cellular Respiration]].
 - Fires also release carbon dioxide as a byproduct into the atmosphere.

### Withdrawal from the atmosphere
 - [[Photosynthesis]] takes in carbon dioxide and uses it to create energy for plants (Rate of [[Photosynthesis]]is much greater that the rate of [[Cellular Respiration]])
 - Carbon Dioxide Exchange (Ocean) - The molecule is dissolved in the surface waters of the ocean. While some of the load remains as it is in a gaseous form, mots of it is chemically combined and turned into other things.
 - Ocean Creatures need to use the remainder of carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate for their shells and exoskeletons.
 - Living things in the ocean can move things downwards towards the bottom of the ocean, where it settles and becomes trapped in rocks due to the immense pressure from the water and other sediments.
