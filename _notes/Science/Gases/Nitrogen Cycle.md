[[Nitrogen]]
# Nitrogen Cycle
### Fixation 
Nitrogen is most commonly found in its gaseous form, something that most living organisms cannot use. However, there is a process called fixation, that creates nitrogen to become a useful things to organisms.
###### Biologically
Nitrogen Gas can be diffused through the soil, and species of bacteria can convert this nitrogen into ammonia ions ($NH_4^+$) which can be used by plants.
##### Through Lightning
Lightning converts the nitrogen in the atmosphere into ammonia and nitrate (NO3) that enter soil through rainfall, where it is then used by plants.
###### Industrially
Scientists have learn how to convert nitrogen atoms to ammonia ($4NH_3^-$), as well as nitrogen rich fertilizers.

### Decomposition
Plants take the nitrogen [[Compound|compounds]] up through their [[Plant|roots]]. Animals obtain these [[Compound|compounds]] when they eat the [[ðŸŒ± Plants|plant]]. When an animal dies, or when waste is [[MRS GREN|excreted]], nitrogen [[Compound|compounds]] reenter the soil in the organic compound, and are broken up by microorganisms known as decomposes.

### Nitrification
Nitrifying bacteria found in the soil convert ammonia into nitrite ($NO_2^-$) and then into nitrate ($NO_3^-$). These compounds can then be used in plants to create the plant and animal proteins.
