# Cross Pollination
Cross Pollination is the pollination of a [[Flowers]] or [[Plant]] with pollen from another [[Flowers]] or [[Plant]]. If a [[Flowers]] on a [[Plant]] has been pollinated from a *different [[Flowers]] on the same [[Plant]], it is not cross pollination, but [[Self-Polination]]*

Self pollination can take place through two methods: [[Insect-Pollination]] or [[Wind-Pollination]].

Generally speaking, cross pollination is found to be better than [[Self-Polination]]. This is because within the species, it could create different mutations for the [[Plant]] to exist in different areas that have different circumstances. This would ensure the survival of the species as if one area was wiped due to a flood or drought, the [[Plant]] still exists in different areas.
