# Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process that [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] use to create [[Glucose]] for [[Cellular Respiration]]. The equation is as stated:
*[[Carbon Dioxide]] + Water ->[[ðŸ’¡ Light]] Sugar + [[Oxygen]]*

From the surrounding air, [[Carbon Dioxide]] is taken in through the guard cells. Water is transported through the [[Xylem]] of the vein. When there is [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] present, photosynthesis will occur, and the sugar is transported to the [[Phloem]] for cellular respiration and the [[Oxygen]] is released for other living animals as a by product.
