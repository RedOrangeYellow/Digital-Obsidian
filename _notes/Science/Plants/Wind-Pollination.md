# Wind Pollination
Wind pollination is done through the wind. This would mean that the [[Flowers]] would no longer need parts such as the nectary as there was no insect to provide a reward from, nor does it need the safeguards such as the sepal as it needs to allow air to freely flow through the [[Flowers]] and around the anther.
