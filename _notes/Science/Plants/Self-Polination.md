# Self Pollination
Self Pollination is when the same [[Flowers]] pollinates itself, or a [[Flowers]] on the same [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] pollinates another [[Flowers]] on the same [[Plant]]. This is the opposite of [[Cross-Pollination]]. 

Self pollination can take place through two methods: [[Insect-Pollination]] or [[Wind-Pollination]]. 

Generally, self pollination is seen as worse than [[Cross-Pollination]] as it does not give variety for the species, as the genes of the resulting seed would be from the same parent. This would give less chance of mutations to occur, thus giving less chances of adaptation. This could result in the death of entire species because the species could only thrive in one area, and that area had something major occur like a flood or drought.
