 [[ðŸŒ± Plants]]
# Plant
### Parts of a plant
###### Root
To absorb water and minerals.
Root hair cell (specialized cell) â€“ Used to increase surface area for absorption.
###### Stem
[[Xylem]] â€“ Unidirectional in transportation, mineral salts and water can only travel upwards of the stem.
[[Phloem]] â€“ transports sucrose and amino acids both up and down the plant, meaning it is translocation.

###### [[Leaf]]
The waxy cuticle is waterproof which reduces water loss through heat and allows [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] to pass through.

###### Upper Epidermis
Protection against water loss and regulates gases exchanges.

###### Palisade Mesophyll
Cells are packed with lots of chloroplast towards the upper part of the [[Leaf]].
They are column shaped and arranged closely together.

###### Spongy Mesophyll
Cells are loosely packed together.
Air space is created to allow to flow of [[Carbon Dioxide]] and other gases to occur.

###### Stomata
Composed of two guard cells.
Guard cells vacuole's loose water (flaccid) and open.
Guard cells vacuole's gain water (turgid) and close.

### Why do we need [[ðŸŒ± Plants]]
[[ðŸŒ± Plants]] give recycle our waste [[Carbon Dioxide]], through [[Photosynthesis]]. They also release [[Oxygen]] as a by product. This would have formed a mutual relationship for every living animal, as [[Oxygen]] is needed for the
