# Reproducibility
The ability to reproduce results from any experiment that proved a theory was important.
           
Reproducibility is important in fields of science as if the results cannot be replicated, one's theory or conclusion on a matter does not count, for it could be an incongruity. This would suggest that their theory based on their conclusion is a one off, disproving the truth in the stated theory.
