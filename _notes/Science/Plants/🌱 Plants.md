# Plants
[[Reproducibility]] is important when sharing results from an investigation. This was the case for Joseph Priestley's.s

Plants are living things, as proved by [[MRS GREN]]. The [[Plant Cells|plant cell]] is a [[Cell]] with organs for a [[Plant]], such as [[Plant Cells|chloroplasts and chlorophyll]]. However, there are [[Similarities and Differences between Animal and Plant Cells|differences between the animal cell.]]

A [[Plant]] has many different organs, each vital for the survival of the [[Plant]]. [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] use [[Photosynthesis]] to create its [[Glucose]]  for [[Cellular Respiration]], as well as storing excesses as starch in fruits . This can be proven through the use of the [[Iodine Test]]. However the [[Rate of Reaction|Rate of photosynthesis]] can greatly change according to the environment around the [[Plant]]. The [[Leaf]] is a vital component of the [[Plant]].

A [[Plant]] needs to transport its glucose and mineral salts around for [[Cellular Respiration]]. This is done through different transportation options, namely - [[Diffusion and Osmosis]], through the [[Xylem]], and through the [[Phloem]].
The movement of water around the [[Plant]] and environment called [[Transpiration]].

A needs to [[MRS GREN|Reproduce]] in order to keep its species alive. There are 
two types of [[Pollination]] - [[Self-Polination]] and [[Cross-Pollination]]. There are also different ways for [[Seed Dispersal]], and only some plants need [[Flowers]].

[[Germination]] takes place shortly after the seed has settled.
