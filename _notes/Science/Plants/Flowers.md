# Flowers
A flower is used in [[Seed Dispersal]], namely through animal dispersal.

### Parts of a flower
###### Male
1. **Anther** - This is where the pollen is created for the flower
2. **Filament** - this supports the anther fore easier access for animals for [[Pollination]]
###### Female
 1. **Stigma** â€“ this is where the flowers take in the pollen grains.
 2. **Style** â€“ this is where the pollen tubes travel down to fertilize the eggs.
 3. **Ovary** â€“ will turn into a fruit when fertilized.
 4. **Ovules** â€“ this is where the female gametes are produced and will turn into a seed once fertilization is complete.
###### Flower
 1. **Petal** â€“ the petal is large and to attract pollinators, they are also to protect the organs of the flower.
 2. **Sepal** â€“ the sepal is used to protect the organs of the flowers.
 3. **Stem** â€“ to connect the flower to the rest of the [[Plant]].
