# Germination
### What is Germination?
Germination takes place shortly after the seed settles down. This is the transition from a seed into a [[Plant]]. A seed only needs three crucial things: [[Energy Forms|heat source]], water, and [[Oxygen]].

Germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed.

### The Cycle of [[ðŸŒ± Plants]]
The seed goes into the ground and grows roots from the heat, water, and [[Oxygen]]. Roots grows into the ground and the embryo shoots up for sunlight.

This turns into a mature [[Plant]], of which it then produces a flower.

Seeds are formed in various ways, and then are spread through different means of seed dispersal such as by animals and wind.
