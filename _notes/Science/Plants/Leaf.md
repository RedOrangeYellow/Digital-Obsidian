# The leaf
### Palisade
The palisade cells at the top of the leaf structure and have more chloroplasts at the top of the cell than a usual [[Plant]] cell.

### Stomata
Composed of two guard cells, both of which have a large vacuole that changes depending on the water level. If it does not have a lot, the stomata open and is called flaccid. If there is a lot of water, it is turgid, and the stomata closes.
