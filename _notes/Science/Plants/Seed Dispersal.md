# Seed Dispersal
### What is Seed Dispersal?
Seed dispersal is the different ways seeds can be dispersed around the area. Seed dispersal is important, as [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] do not want to be super close to one another and be competing for the same resources in the same area. Furthermore, they also want to spread the species to new places to ensure survival in case something happens in the origin where the seed was produces. 

### Seed Dispersal Ways
###### Through Wind
Seeds can be traveled through the wind. [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] like dandelions encase the seed with fluff or other [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] weight material. This would allow for seeds to float some distance away, and even more at certain times.

Another type of  traveling through the wind is when a seed is attached to helicopter like structures. This would slow any decent, giving the seed time to drift away from the location of origin.

###### Through Animals 	
Some [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] have evolved to create spikes on cases that contain the seed. When an animal steps onto it,  it is painfully lodged into the foot. This moves the seed as when the animal moves away from its location of origin, the seed is then moved to a new location, where it would soon fall out.

Another example is seeds that are encased with foods for both animals and humans.  Examples of this could be any fruit. Animals like birds eat the fruit whole, and the seed cannot be digested. The seed is then [[MRS GREN|excreted]] and the seed has moved because of animal movement.   

###### Through Human Interaction
Humans have cultivated [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] for many years; it is no surprise that humans have [[Plant]] farms, where the conditions for the [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] are kept to the most ideal conditions possible.

Another example is through what we use. Our shoes step onto many things, including grass. If it just so happened that there was a seed there, we would have moved it to a new location away from the location of origin.

###### Through Ballistic Means
Certain  [[ðŸŒ± Plants]] can develop seeds that are dispersed through explosions of sorts. These explosions can be caused by either a build up of pressure, or an outside force, such as rain or movement. This would cause the seeds to expand outward, shooting them off into different directions.

###### Through Water
Seeds can travel through water. Water has current, and flows from point A to point B. When a seed happens to land into a river it is transported downstream and settle in a new area away from the original location. The seed is very well protected, and can stay adrift for many days.
