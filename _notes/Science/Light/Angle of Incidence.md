[[Reflection]]
# Angle of Incidence
The ![[Angle of Incidence.png]] is the angle of which a ray of light hits a surface, measured towards the [[Ray Diagrams|Normal]]. The ![[Angle of Incidence.png]] is important to determine the [[Angle of Reflection]].

The angle is often denoted to the letter i, or the Greek letter theta with a subscript of 1, $Î¸_1$. Theta is often used to describe the numerical value of an angle, and the subscript tells us which ray it is, [[Angle of Reflection]] or [[Angle of Incidence]].
