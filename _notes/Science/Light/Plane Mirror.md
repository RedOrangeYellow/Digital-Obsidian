# Plane Mirrors
A plane mirror is a mirror that has a flat (planar) surface. An example of this type of mirror is a normal mirror one would find in there bathroom.

### Image formations through plane mirrors
The image produced by a plane mirror appears to be the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. However, the left appears to be the right and the right appears to be left. This type of reversal is called lateral inversion.

## Uses of Plane Mirrors
Plane mirrors are useful when they are positioned at $45^.$ to each other. This allows for light to be reflected at right angles from the top mirror onto the bottom mirror and into the eye of the viewer. This is known as a periscope, and can be used to see over walls or under walls.
