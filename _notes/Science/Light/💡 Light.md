# Light
*When all light waves are seen together they make white light. When white light shines through  [[Prism]] or through water vapor, it creates a rainbow. This is because the white light is broken apart ([[Refraction|refracting]]), and displaying the colors of the visible [[Electromagnetic Radiation|Light Spectrum]].*

Light is a [[Parts of a Transverse Wave|Transverse Wave]] that can be either [[Reflection|Reflected]], [[Absorption|Absorbed]], or [[Refraction|Refracted]] or [[Transmittion|Transmited]].  This wave travels at 300,000,000 meters per second, which is much faster than the speed of sound. 

There are different types of mirrors: from [[Plane Mirror]], to [[Concave Mirrors]], to [[Convex Mirrors]]. Different objects have different properties: they can be [[Transparent]], [[Translucent]], or [[Opaque]]. These objects can also be [[Luminous]] or [[Non-Luminous]]. 

We represent light on [[Ray Diagrams]]. We can describe the created image in [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|numerous ways]]. One can filter light to their wish by adding [[Colored Filters]].
