[[Reflection]]
# Diffuse [[Reflection]]
Diffuse [[Reflection]] is when the light rays bounce off an uneven surface that causes the light ray to split into multiple beams. This also means that the light rays can be uniform and parallel when approaching the surface, but will be disorientated when it leaves. This is different to [[Specular Reflection]], where all the light rays are in uniform order.
