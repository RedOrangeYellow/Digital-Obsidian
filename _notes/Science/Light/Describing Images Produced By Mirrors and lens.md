# Describing Images Produced by Mirrors and Lens

**Virtual** - The image is not real, and is formed behind the mirror, but it isn't there. This occurs when the light rays diverge away from each other as it must follow the law of [[Reflection]]

**Real** - The image is real, and is formed in front of the mirror. This occurs when the light rays converge together as the light rays must follow the laws of [[Reflection]].

**Diverging** - The light rays after being [[Reflection|reflected]] are moving apart and will never cross the others path.

**Converging** - The light rays after being [[Reflection|Reflected]] are moving together and intercepting 

**Laterally Inverted** - The image produced has the left and right sides mixed up. For example, a raised left hand facing a [[Plane Mirror]] would form a raised right hand because of lateral inversion.

**Vertically Inverted** - The image produced has the top and bottom mixed up. For example, a raised left hand facing a [[Concave Mirrors]] would show a hand where the fingers are underneath the hand.

**Enlarged** - The image produced is bigger than the original object.

**Reduced** - The image produced appears smaller than the original object.
