# Concave Mirrors 
A concave mirror is a mirror that has been bent towards the inside. The light waves are [[Reflection|reflected]] into the focal point.

### Image formation in concave mirrors
There are many different ways images can be formed through concave mirrors.

###### Case 1 - Object located outside the center of curvature
When the object is located outside the center of curvature, the image that appears is [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|real]] and would appear if a sheet of paper had been used to show the object. The image is further [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|Laterially Inverted]]. Furthermore, the image would have a [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|reduction]] in size. It would be found inside the center of curvature and the focal point.

###### Case 2 - Object located at the center of curvature
When the object is located outside the center of curvature, the image that appears is [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|real]] and would appear if a sheet of paper had been used to show the object. The image is further [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|Laterially Inverted]]. Furthermore, the image would have a [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|reduction]] in size. It would be found at the center of curvature, or right underneath the image.

###### Case 3 - Object located between the center of curvature and the focal point
When the object is located between the [[Ray Diagrams|C]] and [[Ray Diagrams|F]], the image formed would be found beyond the center of curvature and is [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|Vertically Inverted]]. The image is also [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|Magnified]] in size. The image formed is also a real image, therefore the image could be created as there are actual light rays converging.

###### Case 4 - Object located at focal point
When an object is located at the focal point, there is no image that can be formed because the [[Reflection|reflected]] rays neither converging nor diverging, therefore, unable to create an image.

###### Case 5 - Object located in front of focal point
The image produced when an object is located in front of the focal point is beyond the mirror itself, a [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|virtual]] image. The image would remain [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|upright]] and [[Describing Images Produced By Mirrors and lens|magnified]].

### Uses of a Concave Mirror
A concave mirror is used to concentrate light waves into a single point, creating a highly concentrated beam. This can be found in torches, telescopes, headlights, and more.
