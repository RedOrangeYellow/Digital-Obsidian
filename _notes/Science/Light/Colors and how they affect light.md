[[Reflection]] [[Absorption]]
# How colors Affect Light
Colors have many properties, and one of these properties affect light directly.

When a black car is placed under the sun with a scoop of ice cream on it, and raced against a car painted white, it is known that the black car melts the ice cream quicker. 

This is because the white light coming from the sun is all [[Absorption|Absorbed]] by the black color of the car, and therefore the [[Energy Forms|light energy]] from the sun is also converted to [[Energy Forms|heat energy]], therefore having both the heat from the sun and the light from the sun as means to melt the ice cream. 

However, this is not the case for the white vehicle. The only thing melting the ice cream is the [[Energy Forms|solar energy]] from the sun. This time, the light is [[Reflection|Reflected]] off the surface.
