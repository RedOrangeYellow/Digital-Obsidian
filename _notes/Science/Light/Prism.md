[[ðŸ’¡ Light]]
# Prism
A prism can split light because of [[Refraction]]. The shorter the [[Electromagnetic Radiation|Wavelength]] of the light, the more it is [[Refraction|Refracted]]. As a result, red light is [[Refraction|Refracted]] the least and violet light is [[Refraction|Refracted]] the most - causing the colored light to spread out to form a spectrum. This is called dispersion.
