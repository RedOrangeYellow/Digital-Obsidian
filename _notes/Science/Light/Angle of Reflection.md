[[Reflection]]
# Angle of Reflection
The angle of [[Reflection]] is the angle of which a ray of light is [[Reflection|Reflected]] off a surface. This angle is measured towards the [[Ray Diagrams|Normal]]. The angle of [[Reflection]] is useful to determine how the light would interact with its environment. 

The angle is often denoted to the letter r, or the Greek letter theta with a subscript of 2, $Î¸_2$. Theta is often used to describe the numerical value of an angle, and the subscript tells us which ray it is, [[Angle of Reflection]] or [[Angle of Incidence]].
