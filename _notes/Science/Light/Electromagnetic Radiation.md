# Electromagnetic Radiation
The electromagnetic radiation is used by scientists to describe the entire range of light that exists. From radio waves to gamma rays, most light in the universe is not visible.

Light is a transverse wave, and it therefore has several properties that describe the wave. This includes the [[Parts of a Transverse Wave|Frequency]] measured in hertz (hz), and [[Parts of a Transverse Wave|Wave Length]]. 

There are only a certain electromagnetic wave range that our eyes can perceive, known as the visible light. Visible light [[Parts of a Transverse Wave|Oscillate ]] between 400 to 790 Terahertz, or 400 trillion to 390 trillion times per second.
