# Refraction
Refraction is when the light hits a surface and and bends. This is because the speed of light changes depends on the material through which the light is traveling. When light enters a different material the speed of light changes and causes the light to bend or refract. The speed of light is affected by the density of the material. The more dense a material is, the slower the speed of light travels.

### Law of Refraction
The law of refraction (Snell's Law) states:
***$$\frac{sin(Î¸_2)}{sin{Î¸_1}} = \frac{v_2}{v_1}$$***
The equation states that the ratio between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction is equivalent to the ratio between the speed of light in the two mediums.

When the [[Angle of Incidence]] is equal to $0^.$, there is no refraction and the light does not bend in any way. If the light is to be leaving the more dense [[Matter]], the light would be expected to be bent away from the normal.

## The effects of refraction
Refraction causes visual effects such as a ruler being bent when placed inside a bottle of water. This happens because the light from the ruler that is submerged is refracting as it travels from water to air.

This also causes the illusion that submerged objects appear to be closer than reality, causing.
