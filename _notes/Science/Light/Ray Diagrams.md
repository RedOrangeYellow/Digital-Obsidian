### What is a Ray Diagram?
A ray diagram is a presentation on how light interacts with its surroundings. Ray diagrams include the [[Angle of Incidence]] and [[Angle of Reflection]] for [[Reflection]]. The [[Angle of Incidence]] and the [[Angle of Reflection|Angle of Refraction]] for [[Refraction]].

### What does a Ray Diagram include?
A ray diagram includes:
**Principal Axis** - The optical axis is perpendicular to the lens or mirror.

**Focal Point** - The focal point is where all the light waves converge.

**Center of Curvature** - The center of curvature is the middle of the mirror if it were a complete circle.

**Focal Length** - The focal length is a measurement from the center of the mirror to the focal point. The higher the focal length, the more the light rays converge, and the lower the focal length, the more the light rays diverge.

**Rays of Light** - Rays of light to show how the light interacts with the mirror. This would be marked with arrows showing the direction of the ray.

**[[Angle of Incidence]]** - The angle of which the light ray hits the mirror, measured towards the normal.

**[[Angle of Reflection]]** - The angle of which the light ray is [[Reflection|reflected]] off the mirror, and is measured towards the normal.

**Normal** - Perpendicular to the surface of which a light ray hits.

### Drawing a Ray Diagram
1. Start by drawing the Principle Axis
2. Draw the mirror
3. Locate the focal point and center of curvature and draw on both sides of the mirror
4.
