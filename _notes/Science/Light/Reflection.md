[[ðŸ’¡ Light]]
# Reflection
[[ðŸ’¡ Light]] can be reflected. This occurs when the [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] wave hits a surface where its boundary does not [[Absorption|Absorb]], [[Transmittion|Transmit]], or [[Refraction|Refract]] the [[ðŸ’¡ Light]]. There are two types of reflections: [[Specular Reflection]] and [[Diffuse Reflection]].

Reflections is most commonly found in mirrors. [[Plane Mirror]], [[Concave Mirrors]] and [[Convex Mirrors]]. There is a reflection law - called the law of reflection. It states that ***the [[Angle of Incidence]] is the same as the [[Angle of Reflection]]*** .

[[Colors and how they affect light|Colors have a large impact on reflection]].

Reflection also creates a phenomenon called [[Total Internal Reflection]] that is based upon the [[Critical Angle]].
