[[Reflection]]
# Specular Reflection
Specular [[Reflection]] is a type of [[Reflection]]. This is when light is bounced off a smooth surface. This ensures that there would not be any unintentional reflections, therefore, when one light ray is hits the surface, only one light ray is bounced off the same surface. However, this is not the case with [[Diffuse Reflection]].
