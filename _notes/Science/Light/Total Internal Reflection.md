[[Reflection]]
# Total Internal Reflection
Total Internal [[Reflection]] is when a beam of light is shot down a tube and does not refract upon hitting the edge of two substances. This is because the [[Angle of Reflection]] is greater than the [[Critical Angle]] and therefore, the light bounces back into the more dense medium.

We use total internal [[Reflection]] in fiber optic cables, were instead of electricity to carry the binary code for computers, light rays that travel at the speed of light do, therefore, improving the internet speed by hundredfold.
