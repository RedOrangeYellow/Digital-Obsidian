[[⚡ Energy]]
# Conduction
The moving particles of a warm [[Solid]] [[Matter|material]] can increase the heat [[⚡ Energy]] of the particles in a cooler [[Solid]] material by [[Transferred|transferring]] it directly from one [[Molecule|particles]] to the next. Since particles are closer together, solids conduct heat better than liquids or gases. The vibrations pass on kinetic motion, transferring heat.
