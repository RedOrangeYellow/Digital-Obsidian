### What is Energy?
Energy is the ability to do work. Energy is how things can change and move, but is bound by the [[Concervation of Energy]]. Joules are used to measure energy, and one joule is the energy [[Transferred]] to an object by the work of moving it a distance of one meter against a force of one newton.  Energy can be found in different types of [[Energy Forms]]. Energy can be [[Transferred]] from one object to another. 

New Zealand uses different energy sources to provide energy to the greater population. The [[Range Of Energy Sources by New Zealand]] found and given to the population is outstanding. We use something called a [[Flow Diagram]] to interpret and draw energy [[Transferred|transfer]] and [[Transformed|transformation]]. 

Another important factor when dealing with energy is its [[Energy Efficiency]] - how efficient is it in doing its task. This shows much much [[Waste Energy|energy is wasted]]. Different [[Matter|materials]] are good [[Conductors]], or could be a good [[Insulator]].

Heat can be [[Transferred]] in three different ways: [[Conduction]], [[Convection]], and [[Radiation]].
