# [[⚡ Energy]] Transformation
[[⚡ Energy]] transformation ([[⚡ Energy]] conversion), is when a [[Energy Forms|energy form]] converts into another form. For example, wind [[⚡ Energy]] can be transformed into kinetic [[⚡ Energy]] to spin a windmills rotor. The [[⚡ Energy]] is converted from wind [[⚡ Energy]] into kinetic [[⚡ Energy]], which is shown by a [[Flow Diagram]].
