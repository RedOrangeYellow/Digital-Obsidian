Hydroelectrical [[⚡ Energy]] comes from the movement of water. The water spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator. [[⚡ Energy]] is often produced in dams, using potential [[⚡ Energy]] of gravity to turn the turbines

[[⚡ Energy]] created from gas comes from from the [[Combustion]] of the gas and a stream of air. The air turns a turbine, therefore creating electricity. Huntly Power Station is an example of this.

Geothermal [[⚡ Energy]] is created when hot air from a spring pushes a turbine, generating electricity. An example of a power station using this method in New Zealand is Central North Island New Zealand.
