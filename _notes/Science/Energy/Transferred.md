# [[⚡ Energy]] Transfer
           
[[⚡ Energy]] transfers are when [[⚡ Energy]] is moved from one object to another, while the [[⚡ Energy]] can be in different forms, such as kinetic motion in water -> kinetic [[⚡ Energy]] in waterwheel. This would have been an [[⚡ Energy]] transfer between the water and the wheel. During transfers, the [[Energy Forms|energy form]] can be [[Transformed]], or stay the same.
