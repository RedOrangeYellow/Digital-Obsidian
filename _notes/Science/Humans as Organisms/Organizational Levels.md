[[ðŸ‘¦ Humans as Organisms]]
# Organizational Levels
1. [[Cell]]
	1. A [[Cell]] is the basic unit of life. There are two kinds of cells: [[Plant Cells]], which have a rigid [[Cell]] wall made of cellulose molecules, and [[Animal Cells]], which have flexible [[Cell]] membranes. [[Cell]] biologists consider questions such as metabolism and other questions about structure and function within and between cells.
2. Tissue
	1. Tissue is made of cells that work together to perform a certain task. Muscle tissue, connective tissue, and neural tissue are some types of tissue. Histologists are an example of biologists who work at this level.
3. Organ
	1. A part of an organism which is typically self-contained and has a specific vital function.
4. Organ System
 	1. An organ system is a group of organs that work together to perform specific bodily functions. The [[Breathing|Respiratory System]], for example, uses the lungs, airways, and respiratory muscles to inhale [[Oxygen]] and release [[Carbon Dioxide]] in animals. Physiologists study the function of parts of the body as they work together. Though physiologists can work at any level of biological organization, they often answer questions related to organ systems.
