# Breathing
Breathing is the process of inhaling [[Oxygen]] for the body to operate due to [[Cellular Respiration]]. Breathing is used in the same manner as the respiratory system.

The breathing (Respiratory) System is composed off multiple parts, as listed:
1. Nasal Cavity â€“ Air is warmed, moisturized, cleaned, and filtered.
2. Oral Cavity â€“ Air can also enter through the mouth.
3. Pharynx â€“ Part of the throat behind the nasal cavity.
4. Larynx â€“ Voice box.
5. Trachea â€“ The windpipe which is held open by rings of cartilage.
6. Bronchi â€“ The trachea branches into 2 bronchi, which serves both lungs.
7. Bronchioles â€“ Bronchi branches into smaller bronchioles.
8. Alveoli â€“ A sheet of muscle below the lungs which along with the ribs results in air coming in and out of the system.

When breathing in, the diaphragm drops down to create more space for the lungs to operate. The ribcage also expands forward to create space for the lungs. This would result in more [[Oxygen]] being pushed into the lung.

[[Gas Exchange]] is when the [[Oxygen]] molecules reach the alveoli, and swaps with [[Carbon Dioxide]] so [[Oxygen]] is transported by the red [[Blood]] cells around the body so the body can preform [[Cellular Respiration]] to get [[âš¡ Energy]].
