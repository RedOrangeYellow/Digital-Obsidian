# Cellular Respiration
Cellular Respiration is a reaction that releases [[âš¡ Energy]] (ATP) from [[Glucose]] This takes place in the [[Parts of the Cell|Mitochondria]] inside both a [[Plant Cells|plant cell]] and an [[Animal Cells|animal cell]].

The word equation is the following:
***[[Glucose]] + [[Oxygen]] -> [[Carbon Dioxide]] + Water + ATP***

The air we breath and the air we breath out are different, with:
### Inhaled Air
Inhaled air is **78% nitrogen, 21% [[Oxygen]], 0.04% [[Carbon Dioxide]]** and small amounts of other gases including argon, [[Carbon Dioxide]], neon, helium, and [[Hydrogen]]. Water vapor is inconsistent.
### Exhaled Air
Exhaled air is by volume **78% nitrogen, 16% [[Oxygen]], 4% [[Carbon Dioxide]]** and small amounts of other gases including argon, [[Carbon Dioxide]], neon, helium, and [[Hydrogen]]. Water vapor increases.

This difference shows that [[Oxygen]] is being taken in, and being used in [[Cellular Respiration]].
