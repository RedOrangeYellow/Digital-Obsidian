[[Heart]]
# Parts of the [[Heart]]
There are many parts of the [[Heart]] that makes it so that it can function properly and pump [[Blood]] around the body.

1. Pulmonary [[Vein]] is connected directly to the lungs, and oxygenated [[Blood]] goes to the [[Heart]] to be pumped around the body from the [[Heart]].
2. Left Atrium is connected to pulmonary [[Vein]] by the , and the left ventricle. The left atrium stores the [[Blood]] in its chamber, and then pumps it to the left ventricle.
3. Left ventricle is found underneath the left atrium, separated by the mitral valve. The left ventricle is responsible for the pumping of [[Blood]], hence the amount of muscle surrounding it around the bottom of the [[Heart]]. [[Blood]] leaves through the aortic valve. 
4. The aorta is connected to the left ventricle by the aortic valve. This is where the [[Blood]] leaves the [[Heart]] and travels to the rest of the body. The Aorta has three different parts, the ascending aorta, the arch, and the descending. 
5. The ascending aorta rises up from the [[Heart]] and is about 5 cm long. The coronary arteries branch off the ascending aorta to supply the [[Heart]] with [[Blood]]
6. The aortic arch supplies [[Blood]] to the head, neck, and arms.
7. The descending aorta travels down through the chest. Its small branches supply [[Blood]] to the ribs and some chest structures.
8. The descending aorta then turns into the abdominal aorta, and  splits to become the paired iliac arteries in the lower abdomen. Most major organs receive their [[Blood]] from here, and further splits to supply [[Blood]] to the legs and feet.
9. The Vena Cava is a large [[Vein]] which carries deoxygenated [[Blood]] back towards the [[Heart]]. It is connected to the right atrium. The Vena Cava is split into two parts, the inferior (coming from the body and legs) and superior (coming arms, neck, head).
10. The right atrium is connected to the Vena Cava and the right ventricle. The atrium is used to pump [[Blood]] to the ventricle and store [[Blood]]. It is separated by the tricuspid valve.
11. The right ventricle is used to pump [[Blood]] back to the lungs, hence the muscles. However, compared to the left ventricle, there is less muscle as it only needs to go to the lungs, and not the body. It is also connected to the pulmonary [[Artery]].
12. The pulmonary [[Artery]] is separated by the pulmonary valve. This [[Artery]] is fed back to the lungs for [[Gas Exchange]] because the [[Blood]] is deoxygenated.
