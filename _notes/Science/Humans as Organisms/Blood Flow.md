# [[Blood]] Flow
1. [[Oxygen]] is inhaled through the mouth or nose.
2. [[Oxygen]] flows down the trachea; the cilia catch unwanted visitors and sends them back to the mouth.
3. [[Oxygen]] is split between the two bronchi.
4. [[Oxygen]] splits even further through many bronchioles.
5. [[Oxygen]] reaches the end, where there are alveoli.
6. Gas diffusion occurs, switching the [[Oxygen]] for [[Carbon Dioxide]].
7. Oxygenated [[Blood]] returns from pulmonary [[Vein]].
8. Oxygenated [[Blood]] flows through the left atrium.
9. Oxygenated [[Blood]] flows through the mitral valve into the left ventricle.
10. Oxygenated [[Blood]] is pumped through the aorta to the body.11. [[Oxygen]] is used by the parts of the body for [[Cellular Respiration]].
	1. 1. [[Oxygen]] + [[Glucose]] -> ATP + Water + [[Carbon Dioxide]]
12. Deoxygenated [[Blood]] carries [[Carbon Dioxide]] back to the [[Heart]].
13. Deoxygenated [[Blood]] enters through the vena cava.
14. Deoxygenated [[Blood]] enters through the right atrium.
15. Deoxygenated [[Blood]] flows through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle.
16. Deoxygenated [[Blood]] is pumped to the lung through the pulmonary [[Artery]].
17. Deoxygenated [[Blood]] is released in an exhale.
