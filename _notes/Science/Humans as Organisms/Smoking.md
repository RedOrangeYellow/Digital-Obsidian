# Smoking
Smoking is dangerous to the [[Breathing|Respiratory System]]. There are several contributing factors, but namely:
1.  **Tar**
	 1. Damages tooth enamel
	 2. Causes decay.
	 3. Sticks to the gum and teeth, making it dirty.
2. **Smoke**
	1. Damages nerve endings in the nose, causing loss of smell.
	2. Increases likelihood of infections.
	 1. Increases likelihood of chronic diseases, such as bronchitis and emphysema.
	3. Damages the cilia (cleaning the air way)
3.  **Carbon monoxide**
	 1. Binds with the [[Blood|haemoglobin]], displacing the [[Oxygen]] that usually would have provided [[Oxygen]] for [[Cellular Respiration]].
	 2. [[Oxygen]] deprivation is caused because the body needs more [[Oxygen]].
1. **Nicotine**
	1. Releases dopamine(pleasure), neurotransmitters, and endorphins which makes smoking highly addictive.
	2. Causes constriction of the [[Blood]] vessels, restricting [[Blood Flow]], creating a higher [[Blood]] pressure. Leads to the thickening of [[Blood]] vessel walls and creates clots. Triggers [[Heart]] attacks and strokes.
	3. Creates dangerous mutations to the DNA, creating cancer.
