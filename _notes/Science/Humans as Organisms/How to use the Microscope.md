# How to use the Microscope
### Microscope parts
 1. Eyepiece lens â€“ where you view the specimen.
 2. Revolving Nosepiece â€“ a rotating object that holds onto all the objective lens
 3. Objective lens â€“ the magnification that you are viewing through. It is color coded for strength.
 4. Stage â€“ where you put the specimen on for viewing.
 5. Stage clips â€“ clips that help secure the specimen for viewing.
 6. Diaphragm â€“ an object that can spin around, each allowing different amounts of [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] through, for viewing purposes.
 7. [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] box/source/ mirror â€“ this redirects [[ðŸ’¡ Light]] through the diaphragm, to the stage so the viewer can see the illuminated specimen.
 8. Coarse adjustment knob â€“ used to move the stage up and down very quickly.
 9. Find adjustment knob â€“ used to move the stage up and down very precisely.
 10. Base â€“ what the microscope stands on, so it is stable
 11. Arm â€“ object attached to the base so stage, eyepiece, objective lens, and revolving nosepiece can be attached.
### Step 1- Create Specimen
1. Get a very thin line of the object you want to view. It must be approximately one [[Cell]] thick.
2. Add a few drops of water to the slide you are going to place the onion skin on to reduce dryness and wilting.
 3. Place the specimen on the slide.
 4. Use anything that can taint the specimen so it can be seen clearly under the microscope. But it should not react with the specimen in case of damaging the sample.
 5. Lay one edge on the short side of a cover slip onto the slide, just before the specimen. Use a pin to lower the other half down. This is to ensure there are no air bubbles.
### Step 2 â€“ Viewing Specimen
 1. Slide the slide onto the microscope, secure with the stage clips.
 2. Start with a 4x magnifier, shortest one, objective lens
 3. Use the coarse adjustment knob so the image comes into view.
 4. Then use the fine adjustment knob so the image details can be seen clearly.
 5. Repeat steps ii â€“ iv, each time using the longer and higher magnification objective lens.
