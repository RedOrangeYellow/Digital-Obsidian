# Humans as Organisms
*[[Heart Disease]] is a common issue among society. Taking the lives of millions every year.*

A living organism has the characteristics of [[MRS GREN]], no [[Matter]] their shape or size. Humans split organisms into two categories, [[Plant Cells]] and [[Animal Cells]]. These two categories share [[Similarities and Differences between Animal and Plant Cells| Similarities and differences]]. There are different [[Organizational Levels]], from cells to organ systems.

To understand how the [[Cell]] works, one must understand [[How to use the Microscope]] to view specimen.

Cells get their [[âš¡ Energy]] through [[Cellular Respiration]]. One of the reactants needed for the reaction to occur is [[Oxygen]]. [[Breathing]] is the process of which humans take that [[Oxygen]] in. The [[Oxygen]] then travels through the [[Breathing|Respiratory system]] to the lungs where [[Gas Exchange]] takes place.

[[Smoking]] is harmful to the body, as well as the [[Breathing|Respiratory System]].

The [[Heart]] is what keeps us alive. This muscle pumps [[Blood]] around the body, which in turn, carries the [[Oxygen]] the muscles and other cells need for [[Cellular Respiration]]. [[Heart Attacks]] are just as common as [[Heart Disease]]. There are three different ways for [[Blood]] to travel, through an [[Artery]], a [[Vein]], or a [[Capillary]].

Keeping the [[Blood Flow|blood flowing]] through the body allows for other vital reactions to take place.
