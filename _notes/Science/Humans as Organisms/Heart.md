# The Heart
The heart is a muscular organ found in most animals, and is used to pump [[Blood Flow|blood]] around the body so there is a constant supply of [[Oxygen]] to the various cells for [[Cellular Respiration]]. 

### Structure of the Heart
The heart is split into four different chambers, upper left and right atria (atrium), and  bottom left and right vertices. All chambers on the labeled with *left* would have been commonly referred to as the left side of the heart, and the same goes for the right side of the heart.

A heart has [[Parts of the Heart|valves]], preventing the [[Blood]] from flowing backwards, and continuously ensuring that the oxygenated [[Blood]] and deoxygenated [[Blood]] stayed away from each other and never mixed.

The heart has many [[Parts of the Heart|different features]] that ensure the continuous flow of oxygenated and deoxygenated [[Blood]] around the body.
