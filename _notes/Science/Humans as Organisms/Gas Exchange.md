# Gas Exchange
Gas Exchange is the physical process of which [[ðŸ’¨ Gases]] move from one area of high pressure to fill in an area of low pressure, as [[ðŸ’¨ Gases]] move to fill and expand the area that is free.

In relation to the [[Breathing|Respiratory System]], when the [[Oxygen]] reaches the [[Breathing|alveoli]] when inhaling, the [[Oxygen]] is swapped with the [[Carbon Dioxide]] that was stored in the red [[Blood]] [[Cell]]. 

This occurs because the pressure outside the body is significantly greater than that of the alveoli, therefore [[Oxygen]] rushes into alveoli, and can be further mitigate the pressure difference by swapping places with the [[Carbon Dioxide]].

When exhaling, the [[Carbon Dioxide]] is pushed out through the squeezing of the lungs and the physical movement of the diaphragm.
