# Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
The student Nonviolent Coordinating committee was a student committee founded during 1961. This group had participated in, but not limited to: [[Greensboro Sit-Ins]], [[Freedom Rides]], [[March on Washington]], and others.

This group had emerged from the [[Greensboro Sit-Ins]], and had assist direct-action challenges to the civic segregation and political exclusion of African Americans.

During the 1960's, they had created close contacts with the [[SCLC]], but had eventually merged with the Black Panther Party in 1968, and the organization had disbanded.
