Americans from all over the country came to show their support, regardless of race and origin. It had two main aims: a) to protest the ongoing issues of racial segregation, and b) to show support for the 1964 Civil Rights Bill that President John F. Kennedy introduced in 1963. By 11:30am that day, 200 000 people had already gathered at the Washington Monument, which was strategically chosen as the starting point of the march; it commemorated the founder of [[America]].
