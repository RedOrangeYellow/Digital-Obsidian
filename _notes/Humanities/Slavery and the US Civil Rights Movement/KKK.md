# Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux KlanÂ was founded in 1866 by ex-Confederate soldiers and other Southerners after the Civil War.

The Klan disbanded for 50 years. In 1915, "Colonel" William Joseph Simmons, revived the Klan after seeing D. W. Griffith's film Birth of A Nation, which portrayed the Klansmen as great heroes. 

The Klan moved beyond just targeting black Americans, and broadened its message of hate to include Catholics, Jews and foreigners.

By the middle of the 1920s, estimates for national membership in this secret organization ranged from three million to as high as eight million Klansmen.
