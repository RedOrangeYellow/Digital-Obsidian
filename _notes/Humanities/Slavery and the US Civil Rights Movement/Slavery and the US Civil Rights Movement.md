# [[Slavery]] and the US Civil Rights Movement
### [[Slavery]]
[[Slavery]] had began [[Before the Transalantic Slave Trade]]. There was also a kingdom located on the west coast of Africa, where they had there own slaves, called [[The Kingdom of Mali]]. [[Slavery]] had started to take place when [[The Middle Passage]] had been created as part of the [[Transalantic Slave Trade]]. 

[[Slavery|Slaves]] that had arrived in [[America]] had been placed in various plantations for manual labor. These plantations were found in the South. North and South had [[North Vs. South|differnt views]] on [[Slavery]], with the North being against it, and the South being For it. [[Harriet Tubman]] had helped a lot of slaves escape.

This created tension between the two sides of [[America]], and it started the [[American Civil War]], fought between the North and the south. The war had led to the [[End of Slavery]]. [[The Aftermath]] of the Civil War was exponential, as the South did not take it lightly which lead to cases like [[Little Rock Case|Little Rock]], [[Brown Vs. Board]], [[Emmett Till]], and an White Supremacist Group being formed, known as the "[[KKK]]"

This had caused the [[North Vs. South|North]] to revolt, and protest for the rights of the African American Community. Events such as [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], [[Greensboro Sit-Ins]], [[Freedom Rides]], [[Birmingham Campagin]], [[March on Washington]], and [[Freedom Summer]]. These events were all assisted through the help of mainstream organizations such as the [[NAACP]], [[CORE]], the [[SCLC]], and [[SNCC]], which saw the rise of great leaders such as [[Martin Luther King]], and [[Malcom X]].

All these groups had helped pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],  the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and[[ Civil Rights Act of 1968]].
