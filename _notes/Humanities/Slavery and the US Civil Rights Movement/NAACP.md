[[Slavery and the US Civil Rights Movement]]
# The NAACP Organization
The NAACP is a Civil Rights Organization founded in 1909. The NAACP wants to **"ensure the political, educational, equality of minority group citizens of the United States and eliminate race prejudice."**

One of the organizations key victories during the Civil Rights Movement was the [[Brown Vs. Board]] case, which outlawed segregation in schools. The NAACP had also helped organizing the [[March on Washington]], as well as [[Freedom Summer]].

Furthermore, they had also successfully lobbied for the passage of the landmark legislation, which included the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

People working for the organization were also exposed to violence and danger, with assassinations taking multiple lives of the organizations key members, all carried out by White supremacist.
