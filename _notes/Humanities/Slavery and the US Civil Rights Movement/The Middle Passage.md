# The Middle Passage
The Middle Passage was the voyage the [[Slavery|slaves]] from Africa took to get across the Atlantic. They were take from their homes on the 'Slave cost' (West coast) of Africa, and then put onboard a ship and taken to the Caribbean of [[America]]. This voyage was part of the [[Transalantic Slave Trade]].
### What was the voyage like for the enslaved?
1. Cramped, each person had 2 feet 7 inches of room, which is 78.74cm width to sleep in, basically sleeping without moving at all, since they over packed the ship with as many enslaved as possible to get as much out of one voyage as possible.
2. New diseases were spread out, flu and other sicknesses were passed to many slaves, because of the confined area they rested in. Sea sicknesses was also very common, resulting in puking. "The smell made all ships steer clear of all incoming slave boats."
