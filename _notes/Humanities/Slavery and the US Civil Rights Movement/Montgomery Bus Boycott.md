# Montgomery Bus Boycott

In Montgomery 1955, the civilians were still forced under Jim Crow Laws, and segregation on buses was one of them. The African Americans were forced to sit at the back of the bus, and if the bus was fill, they had to give up their seat if a white person did not have one and they wanted to sit. On December the first, 1955, Rosa Parks was coming home from work on the bus and sat at the front row of the colored section. When the white section of the bus was filled, the bus driver J. Fred Blake asked her and three others to vacant their seats. Although the others had left, Parks had stayed in her seat, and refused to give it up. She was arrested and fined $10, and $4 in court fees.

This was not the first time Parks had an encounter with this bus driver. In 1943, she had paid him at the front, and left through the front to enter the colored section through the back gate. However, when she had gotten off the bus, the bus had left without her, with her money.

She was bailed out of jail, and the incident was widely spread and African American leaders across Montgomery began helping each other. On the 4th of December, the _Montgomery Advertiser_, a popular newspaper, published the plan of action for the people in Montgomery. Ninety percent of the bus ridership of Montgomery was African Americans.

Initially, the demands did not include changing the segregation laws; rather, the group demanded courtesy, the hiring of Black drivers, and a first-come, first-seated policy, with whites entering and filling seats from the front and African Americans from the rear.

Ultimately, however, a group of five Montgomery women, represented by attorney Fred D. Gray and the [[NAACP]], sued the city in U.S. District Court, seeking to have the busing segregation laws totally invalidated.

Although African Americans represented at least 75 percent of Montgomery’s bus ridership, the city resisted complying with the protester’s demands. To ensure the boycott could be sustained, Black leaders organized carpools, and the city’s African American taxi drivers charged only 10 cents—the same price as bus fare—for African American riders.

Many Black residents chose simply to walk to work or other destinations. Black leaders organized regular mass meetings to keep African American residents mobilized around the boycott.

This event had [[Martin Luther King]] as its head.
