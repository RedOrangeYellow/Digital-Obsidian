[[Slavery and the US Civil Rights Movement]]
# Before the Transatlantic Slave Trade
There were many people on the world who held different beliefs based on the subject of Africa; Some people loved it, so people hated it.
### David Hume's Assessment
David Hume writes            

*_"I am apt to suspect the negros, and in general all the other species of men (For there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There Never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, even any manufacturers amongst them, no arts no sciences. On the other hand, the most rude and barbarous of the whites, such as the ancient_ Germans_, the present_ Tartars_, have something eminent about them, in their valour, form of government or some other. Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen, in so many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men. Not to mention our colonies, there are_ Negro _slaves dispersed all over_ Europe _of which none ever discovered any symptom of ingenuity tho’ low people, without education, will start up amongst us, and distinguish themselves as a man of parts and learning: but ‘tis likely he is admired for very slender accomplishments, like a parrot, who speaks a few words plainly".*

***Hume's image was negative as he had a very low regard of the Africans, describing them as inferior, intellectually challenged, and culturally backward***.

### Duarte Barboosa's Assessment
Duarte Barboosa said ‘There were many fair houses of stone and mortar, well organised in streets. Around it was streams and orchards with many channels of sweet water.Of the people who lived in Kiliwa he reported, ‘They were finely clad in (wore) many rich clothes of gold and silk, and cotton, and the women as well; also, with much gold and silver in chains and bracelets, which they wore on their legs and arms, and many jewelled earrings in their ears.’

Source B has a **positive view** on Africa, as the following suggests:
1. "Houses of stone and mortar, well organized in streets".
2. "[…] many rich cloths of gold and silk".
3. "Gold and silver in chains and bracelets".
4. "Jewelled earrings in their ears".
          
***Barboosa's image was positive as he thought that they were well presented, organised and wealthy.***
### Why are their viewpoints different?
- **Their origins where different.**
	- Hume was a philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist, meaning he was judging all of Africa by their culture,, and their doings.
	- Barboosa was a Portuguese trader, or merchant, meaning how he was Africa was through its high economic value
- **Time Era was different.**
	- Hume reported his piece much later than Barboosa, meaning that Africa might have changed during that time.
- **Hume might have never even gone to Africa.**
	- Hume could have never gone to Africa, and possible wrote from other first and second-hand information, which may have bias in them, even if he was not bias in the first place.
	- Society bias also may have impacted his thoughts.
