[[Slavery and the US Civil Rights Movement]]
# The End of [[Slavery]]
### How did it end?
Due to Union measures such as the Confiscation Acts and the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, the war effectively ended chattel [[Slavery]] in most places. Following the Union victory, the institution was banned in the whole territory of the United States upon the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865.
### How did the south take it?           
The [[North Vs. South|South]] did not take it lightly, and most measures that were introduced was taken with resistance. Many measures took a significant time to pass through. An example of this is the [[Brown Vs. Board]] of Education case, where the southern states did not accept the change in racial segregation in schools. Another example is the [[Little Rock Case]].
