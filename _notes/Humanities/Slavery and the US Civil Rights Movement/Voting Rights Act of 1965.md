[[Slavery and the US Civil Rights Movement]]
# Voting Rights Act of 1965
The Voting Rights Act of 12965 had allowed the African American population of [[America]] to overcome the legal barriers that the population faced when trying to vote; laws specifically targeted against the African Americans that prevented them from voting. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is considered one of the most far-reaching pieces of Civil Rights legislation in the US.

[[Martin Luther King]] and the [[NAACP]] had pushed for Voting Rights during the Selma to Montgomery marches that were peaceful, yet met with violence and resistance from the White supremacist.
