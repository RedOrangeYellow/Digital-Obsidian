[[Slavery and the US Civil Rights Movement]]
# Civil Rights Act of 1964
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 had decreed that discrimination on the biases of race, color, religion, sex or national origin to be illegal. This prohibited the segregation in many schools, restrooms, restaurants around the States. This had helped the African American Community to work and enjoy privileges that used to be reserved for the White population only. 

However, this did not outlaw the discrimination against those who had disabilities, especially those who were African or other minor countries. 

This act had been successfully lobbied by the lawyers of the [[NAACP]] organization.
