# Freedom Summer
‘Freedom Summer’ was the summer of 1964, occurring mainly in Mississippi (though it also spread to other states). It had many objectives and goals, with the overarching aims to empower black Mississippians to participate in local, state, and national politics, and to focus Americans’ attention on the inhuman conditions of segregation, allowing for the passing of laws to ensure equality of the races.

One of its main goals was to increase voter registration among the black community. The organizers wanted as many blacks to register to vote as possible and sought to expose the injustice of the blacks being denied the right to vote. It was hoped that revealing the contradiction with American democratic ideals (as outlined in the 15th Amendment to the constitution).

Another key objective was to set up ‘Freedom Schools’. This was important because the state’s poorly funded, segregated public schools did not effectively educate the black population. Therefore, civics, African American history, social studies, reading, and math, as well as develop leadership skills were taught in these ‘Freedom Schools’. In this way, both children and adults could get an education in convenient buildings, such as churches and storefronts.
