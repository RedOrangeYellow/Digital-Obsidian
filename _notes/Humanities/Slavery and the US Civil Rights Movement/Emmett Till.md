# Emmett Till           

Emmett Till was a young boy from Chicago, Illinois. This was a place where there was no segregation â€“ he had white friends and a white girlfriend. Upon arriving at Mississippi to visit relatives, he had been dared by the local boys to flirt with a white wife (Carolyn Bryant) of a local grocery shop. Because Illinois is a northern state, they had been against [[Slavery]] and the Jim Crow Laws. However, Mississippi is very pro-segregation. The state had completely disregarded the removal of the Jim Crow Laws. It was an unwritten rule that the African Americans and the Whites should not mix. 

Several nights after the incident, Carolyn's husband, and his stepbrother (J.W Milam) left in search of Emmett. They were armed and had abducted the young boy. They had taken him and had castrated him, gored out one of his eyes, cut his ear off, and shot him dead through the head, and tied him to barbed wire. Three days later, his body was spotted floating in the Tallahatchie River.

In a trial in September 1955, the two men responsible for Till's death was found not guilty, due to the courtroom being filled with an all-white Jury. This allowed the duo to publicly admit that they had been the ones who had killed Till in an interview with Look Magazine. They were not convicted for the crime as you were not allowed to be convicted for the same crime twice.
