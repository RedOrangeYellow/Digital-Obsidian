[[Slavery and the US Civil Rights Movement]]
# Little Rock
The Little Rock case was a decision made in  response to the passing of the [[Brown Vs. Board]] case.

           

Governor Orval Faubus wanted to become governor, and he could gain more votes through getting the segregationist votes. Following through, he had ordered the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the African American students from enrolling at Central High School. This school was an all-white school.

However, President Eisenhower arranged to meet the Governor to discuss the growing situation in little Rock. Eisenhower thought Faubus had agreed to enroll African American students, so he told Faubus that his National Guard troops could stay at Central High and enforce order. Once back in Little Rock, Governor Faubus withdrew the National Guard. A few days later, 9 African American students slipped into the school to enroll, and a full-scale riot erupted. The situation quickly ran out of control.

Seeing the situation, the mayor appealed directly to the president, and he had placed the National Guard under federal control and sent 1000 extra US Paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division to help restore order in Little Rock.
