[[Slavery and the US Civil Rights Movement]]
# Birmingham Campaign
The Birmingham Campaign was a African American Civil Rights Movement organized in the early 1963's by the [[SCLC]], and focused on the bringing of integration in Birmingham, Alabama.

The organization was lead by [[Martin Luther King]], and was a non-violent direct action campaign, but it saw violence being used to push them back.

The campaign began with a boycott which was designed to put pressure on the business leaders to open work spaces for all races. When this approach did not work, they had to resort to "Project C", where a series of sit-ins and marches used to provoke mass arrest, which did happen.

This caused a shortage of volunteer adults, so they had to rely on school kids. A leader of the organization, James Bevel, had trained them to protest with non-violent ways. He had asked them to participate in a walk from 16th Street Baptist Church to City Hall in order to talk to the mayor about segregation, in groups of 50 at any given time. 

This had ended with over a thousand arrests, with jails being overrun with students. This had caused the police department to resort to using highly pressurized water hoses to run the demonstrators down, as well as using trained attack dogs.

Both [[Martin Luther King]] and the [[SCLC]] had been criticized and praised for the use of children in demonstrations.
