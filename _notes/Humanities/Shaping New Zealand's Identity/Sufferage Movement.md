[[Shaping New Zealand's Identity]]
# Suffrage Movement
The suffrage movement was a movement that lasted for a decade, and fought for the woman's right to vote. New Zealand had become the first country to give woman the vote.

### Plot
On the 9th of September 1893, New Zealand woman had gained the right to vote.

The movement had been inspired by John Stuart Mill’s philosophy of equality, as well as British Feminists and the organization [[WCTU]]. They had created a Suffrage Petition that gained the signature of 31,872 woman across the country.

[[Kate Sheppard]] realized that the right to vote would give women the power to campaign for their rights, address reforms on temperance (limiting sale and drinking of liquor) and welfare concerning children and women. [[Kate Sheppard]] was instrumental in obtaining the largest petition ever presented to Parliament in 1893 with nearly 32,000 signatures.

On 8 September 1893 the bill was passed in parliament. Governor Glasgow signed the new Electoral Act on 19 September 1893 and women in New Zealand went to the polls for the first time on 28 November of that year.

### Leaders and Organizations
This movement was assisted by [[Kate Sheppard]], and the [[WCTU]],  as well as [[Polly Plum]], [[Meri Te Tai Mangakahia]], and [[Iriaka Matiu Rātana]].
