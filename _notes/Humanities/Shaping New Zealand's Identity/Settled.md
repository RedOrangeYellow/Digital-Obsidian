****

A strong regional variation within New Zealand as to where different groups had settled in the country. 

 - Wellington and Canterbury were havens for the English people. This reflects their [[New Zealand Company]] origins.
 - Auckland has a number of people from Ireland which reflected partly due to the influence of early military settlers and partly of the free migration of Irish across the Tasman to Auckland.
 - Westland had a large number of people from Ireland, most of which had hopped on for the Gold Rush.
 - Otago and Southland had a British tone imprinted.
