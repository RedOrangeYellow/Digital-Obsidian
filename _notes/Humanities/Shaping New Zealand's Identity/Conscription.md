# Conscription
The First World War had introduced conscription to New Zealand. It was introduced as the number of volunteers had fell underneath the minimum requirement. The Military Service Act of 1916 required the registration of non-Maori men aged 20 to 46.

Some were chosen by ballot, initially from the first division and later from the second, and sent to training camps. The conscription had tried on be spread to the Maori in 1917, but no Maori that had been conscripted had seen active service oversees.
