# (New Zealand) Christian Temperance Union
NZWCTU was New Zealand’s first women’s organization, and the members were united by a concern due to the damage that alcohol abuse did to families. The first 10 branches of the organization were formed within 7 months of its creation by 1885. Included all matters affection women and tried to promote no sales of alcohol to those under 21. They had classes in healthy clothing, food and diets for the sick, preschool centers run by WCTU volunteers, support for people fighting for better conditions for women in work, soup kitchens and raised funds for a homeless shelter. They are most well-known for the campaign to gather the right to vote for women which got 32,000 signatures from 13 regional petitions.
