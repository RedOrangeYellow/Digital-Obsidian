[[Shaping New Zealand's Identity]]           
# Kate Sheppard
Kate was born in Liverpool and had an excellent education in sciences, arts, and law before she moved to New Zealand. She was an active member of the Trinity Congregational Church, and she became involved in the temperance movement. She also volunteered to become a secretary for the Ladies Associations. She was one of the founding members of the NZWCTU. She co-ordinate and encouraged all the local temperance unions and promoted it through pamphlets, letters, newspapers, and lobbied politicians. She was involved and spoke in many public meetings and believed that everything that separates humans from being equal should be overcome. She was also frustrated that woman did not have the right to vote and put into the same category as children, lunatics, and criminals.

A quote from her:
"All that separates, whether of race, class, creed or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome."
