[[Shaping New Zealand's Identity]]
# Polly Plum
Polly had no independent legal status, and no control over property or guardianship of their children. She had spoken out because of her fathers' ruinous use of her wages. She had argued that women were entitled to education, careers, and the vote. She had agreed that while the role of woman in the house was still important, it was not appropriate to educate girls purely for life inside the house. However, she was met by both applauded and outrage from both men and women. However, many still did support her.
