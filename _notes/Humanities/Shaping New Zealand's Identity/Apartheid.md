# Apartheid
The apartheid was a system of legislation that upheld segregation policies against non-white citizens of South Africa. Under this system, non-white people of South Africa (a majority of the population) had to live separate to the White people of South Africa. In 1991, the government of President F.W. de Klerk had began disassembling the system along with Nelson Mandela, a civil rights activist.

### Resistance
There were many types of resistance over the years through demonstrations, protests, to strikes to dictate actions were needed. However, nothing changed so they had eventually gave on peaceful protests and become violent.

In 1960 a black town called Sharpesville had been open fired upon by the police. The people who died were close associates with the PAN ([[Pan-African Congress]]), which was a branch off the [[African National Congress]]. 67 people were killed and more than 180 were wounded. This incident had convinced many anti-apartheid leaders that peaceful protests would not change anything, and only violence would bring change.
