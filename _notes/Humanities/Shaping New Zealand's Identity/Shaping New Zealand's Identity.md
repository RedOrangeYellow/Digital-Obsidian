# Shaping New Zealand's Identity

New Zealand was a newly colonized country by the British people. However, they were not the first. The first people to come to New Zealand were the Maori from the pacific islands.

New Zealand's first major event that had gained the attention of those around the world was the [[Sufferage Movement]]. The woman at the time were fed up about being [[Role of Woman in 19th Century|submissive]] to their husbands. Major people that played a key role in the successive movement were [[Polly Plum]], [[Meri Te Tai Mangakahia]], [[Iriaka Matiu Rātana]], and [[Kate Sheppard]]. Groups and organizations involved in the movement include: [[WCTU]],

New Zealand also played a minor role in the first World War. New Zealand, along with Australia, had introduced [[Conscription]], and had used [[Recruitment Posters]] as a means of propaganda for the government. [[Statistics on new Zealand and World War 1|Statistics]] show that New Zealand was quick to join the war, with 10% of the total population being away to fight for [[Britain]]. New Zealand saw its first success in the taking of [[German-Occipied Western Samoa]]. However, the war also saw the [[Objectors and Deserters]] rise up, who were eventually punished. The most known campaign is the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], which saw the deaths of thousands.

Another standout was [[Sir Edmund Hillary]]. He was known for being the first person to [[Climbing the Unclimbable - Mount Everest|conquer Mount Everest]]. Hillary had further lead the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctica Expedition]] during the years of 1957–58. The group had set up Scott Base, as well as food and fuel depots. They had become the [[Reaching the South Pole|First group to reach to South Pole]]. Lastly, [[Sir Edmund Hillary]] had written best-selling books that documented his adventures.

The next major event that had gathered international interest was the [[Springbok Tour]]. The [[Apartheid]] policy played a big part. The two rugby teams (Springboks, All Blacks) had met two times. The First Encounter had resulted in the widespread shock at the white individuals that would go on to cheer for the Maori team. The Second Encounter had resulted in a mass protest and demonstrations. The United Nations were also involved in this.

[[The Mount Erebus Disaster]] made its impact on New Zealand reputation. After just opening up to the world, the flight had killed many from all around the world. [[The Flight]] and included 236 passengers.

[[Rainbow Warrior]] was a direct consequence of voicing out opinions. The campaign had aimed to become nuclear free, and save the pacific islands while doing it. The [[Greenpeace]] Organization had been planning, and France didn't like it.

[[British and Irish Migration]] saw many people Europe coming to New Zealand in search for a new life. People took the risk as their were too many [[Push and Pull Factors|push factors to leave Britain]], and a few [[Push and Pull Factors|pull factors]] to choose New Zealand over America. The [[Voyage to New Zealand|Voyage]] one would take was called the [[Voyage]] of luck, as ones survival tended to be uncertain when crossing to New Zealand, and took over 3 months. The immigrants [[Settled]] in numerous places, most prominent were Wellington and Canterbury. The [[New Zealand Company]] had influenced a lot of people to come to New Zealand on false promises.

The [[Dawn Raids]] basically sent people back to their country of origin based on an assumption that they had overstayed their visa. The police who consulted with the people came very early in the morning, therefore becoming known as the dawn raids.

Very Recently, there was the [[Christchurch Mosque Shooting]] that saw 51 people dead in the year 2019.
