[[Apartheid]]
# African National Congress (ANC)
The ANC is social-democratic political party in South Africa. The party has been in power since the Nelson Mandela had come into power.

The group had been formed on the 8th of  January, 1912. The primary mission was to bring the people of Africa together, and defend their rights and freedoms. In turn, this included giving full rights to the Black community.

The group had originally planned to use nonviolence to create an end to the [[Apartheid]] policies, but after countless demonstrations that did not go to plan, they simple chose to use violence against the violence they were receiving.
