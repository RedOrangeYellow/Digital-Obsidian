[[Shaping New Zealand's Identity]]
# Objectors and Deserters
Although many New Zealanders were keen to fight, some believed that it was wrong. This was usually because of religious or moral objections to the war.

When called up to fight, conscientious objectors refused to go. The wider community and the government often had little patience or sympathy. Resisters often faced a violent and hostile reaction.

Some were forced to go to the battlefield and given Field Punishment Number One.

Five New Zealanders were executed during WW1 â€“ most were executed for desertion. Victor Spencer of the Otago Battalion was the last Allied soldier to be executed in WW1, in February 1918.
