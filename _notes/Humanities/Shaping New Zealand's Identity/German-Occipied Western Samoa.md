# German-Occupied Western Samoa
NZ’s first active campaign was in August 1914, with the taking of German-occupied Western Samoa.

The small German force there was captured without putting up any resistance. The two German warships in the harbor could have opened fire, but they chose to withdraw instead.

NZ took the first enemy-held territory in the war. Many soldiers believed that the war would be ‘over by Christmas’.

Captives were taken to Motuihe Island in the Hauraki Gulf near Auckland and imprisoned there, along with German and Austrian civilians who had been in NZ when the war broke out.
