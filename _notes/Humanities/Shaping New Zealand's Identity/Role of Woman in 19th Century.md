# Role of Woman in 19th Century
The role of woman in the 1800's were to stay submissive to their husbands. They were treated like property, with the transfer from being her "father's" to becoming her "husband's" when marriage occurred. Because society at the time was very male dominated, few stood up and spoke, weary of the consequences they face.

The woman would not be permitted to hold opinions on politics or anything other than what they worked with, such as food and house care. They were mean to act as if they did not have any intelligence on any matter other then what they should know. Lastly, the woman are portrayed as "Fragile little things", an attempt on objectifying them.
