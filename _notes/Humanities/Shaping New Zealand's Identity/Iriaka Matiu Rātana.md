[[Shaping New Zealand's Identity]]           
# Iriaka Matiu Rātana
The first Māori Woman to be elected to Parliament. She was a passionate advocate for the state of her people. Coming from the Western Māori electorate for Labor in November 1949, she had succeeded her husband Māori Rātana to become the first woman to represent Māori in the New Zealand parliament.

However, her nomination and election were not without common debate within the Māori society. Tainui leader Te Puea Herangi had earlier declined to stand for Parliament on the grounds that no woman should 'captain the Tainui waka'.

Despite the criticism, she had won the election by a wide margin and had held onto the Western Māori for 20 years, until her retirement in 1969.
