The graphs above tells us that:
 - Welsh: Throughout the whole period the Welsh were significantly under-represented among New Zealand's immigrants. This may be partly because they were far from the major ports of London and Glasgow.
 - English: For the first fifty years of settlement in New Zealand the English were represented about in proportion to their population at home; but they were especially well represented in the [[New Zealand Company]] settlements.   
 - Scots: Scotland was a very significant source of New Zealand's immigrants throughout the 19th century, and Scots immigrants were consistently more than double their representation in the United Kingdom itself.
 - Irish: The Irish pattern is quite different again. They were under-represented for the first fifty years of settlement.
