[[Shaping New Zealand's Identity]]
# The New Zealand Company
The New Zealand Company was established in 1938. It bought land from the iwi to sell to the settlers that they brought to New Zealand for a profit. The settlers would then provide aid in cultivating the landowner's lands, therefore allowing them to eventually buy their own land. However, pay was very low, therefore would take many years to finish.

The [[Settled]] would also buy and sell land to make profit. 

The company was based in all major cities in New Zealand at the time: Wellington, Nelson, Wanganui, Dunedin, New Plymouth and Christchurch.Between 1840 and 1852, the New Zealand Company brought 15,000 European settlers of generally good stock and character to New Zealand.Whatever their purpose in coming, it did result in some conflict with Māori over land - as evidenced in the Wairau Affray (1843).This was the beginning of the demise of the Company in 1858, which was already struggling with financial and political difficulties. The company and its colonization plans had never been fully supported by the British Government.
Its dissolution in 1858 obliged the British Government to establish full colonial governance of the country.
