However, Hitler was a man of intelligence, and had managed to use these problems to his advantage by playing with the members of society. In other words, it was of [[His Actions]] that had let him win a powerful position.

# History (How he got his extreme views)
**Adolphus Hitler** was born in **1889**, in the small town in Austria-Hungary called Braunau am Inn. His father was **Alois Schicklgruber**, but soon changed his name to Alois Hitler, that of his fathers. Hitler's mother was **Klara Hitler**, and Hitler was the only child to survive infancy. However, Hitler's father was quick to anger, and had *physical punishments* dealt to their sons. Adolf's older brother had *run away at 14*.

Adolf was very attached to his mother, how constantly worried about Hitler's health. At first, Hitler did well in school, and often leaded *war games* with fellow friends. He had also liked stories about Cowboys and Indians. However, as he grew older, he became more rebellious. He was *caught [[Smoking]]*, *leading a raid on an orchard*, *and bullied his pro-Austria teacher*.

The relationship between his father and him was so great, that Hitler purposefully went against his father. *Since his father was a Public Official in Austria, Hitler got big into Germany Nationalism*. Tragedy Struck, and Hitler's younger brother had died. This had evoked severe emotional change. Hitler was no longer doing good in school, and was reported for talking to trees and staring at the sky where his brother had died.

He had soon began looking for a job after dropping out of high school and failing to enter Vienna College for Arts. This had large impact on the young adult, and he had spent most of his time on the streets looking for a shelter. It was at this time that Hitler had formed his extreme ideology. The town had widespread **Anti-Semitism**, and the mayor, whom Adolf supported, was an outspoken **[[Anti-Semite]]**, something Hitler supported him with.

Hitler had taken key interests into the extreme *right wing* newspapers, all of which were [[Anti-Semite]]. There were many *conspiracy theories* many of which Hitler had believed. He believed that there were many races, and there was constant struggle with one another. At the top of the race pyramid was the **German Aryan** people, and at the bottom, were the **Jewish** population.

Upon becoming a firm believer in these theories, Hitler moved to Germany. He still faced the same fate as he did before he moved, constantly on the move. However, it was at this time when something big had happened, something that was a [[Major Events around the Globe]]. World War | had come.

Hitler had soon became a solider to participate in the war, and was reportedly being a brave solider, having being awarded the iron cross - first class. Hitler had said that it was the best time of his life, against all the horrors that war could bring.
