# Nazi Germany and the Holocaust
Nazi Germany was the direct result of [[Hitler's Rise to Power]], which allowed Hitler to a power position, powerful enough to start setting his methods into action to achieve their [[Ideology and Beliefs]].  By indoctrinating the young was a very important part, and they did so through the [[Hitler Youth]].  Furthermore, they had taken control of the [[Education]] system, using it as a means of propaganda to yet again, target the children. Their [[Education]] had many examples that prompted the children to think differently, even if the idea was not specifically mentioned, many kids had still picked it up, and were being indoctrinated by their [[Ideology and Beliefs]]. However, this is all targeted against the children, and children were easy to control when surrounded by the same beliefs. However, adults had already created their own opinions on the government. This had forced the Party to use fear and discipline to [[Control of the Wider Population]].  However, not everyone was indoctrinated so easily, and there were many [[Youth Opposition Groups]] formed. 

Furthermore, many of Hitler's inner circle had tried to assassinate him, with over 80 attempts to take his life. The [[July Bomb Plot]] is just one of the many that came close. All of this chaos had made affected the [[Jewish Life before the War]], caused a surge in the [[Anti-Semite]]s, and there were now different factions. They were the [[Perpetrators, Collaboraters, Bystanders, Rescuers, and Resistors]]. The horrors that the detained had ended with the [[Liberation]] of the prisoners. 

Finally, when the war was over, the [[Nuremberg Trials]] had taken place, and the Nazi Regime was nothing more.
