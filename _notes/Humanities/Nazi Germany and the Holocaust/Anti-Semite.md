[[Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]
# Anti-Semite
*The term "anti-Semite" was  a term used to describe someone who was hostile and prejudiced against the Jewish population.*

The Jewish people had always been barred from entering positions that other races wanted, so all work they did was related to money, taxed, and loans. This created a view on the Jews as people who were constantly robbing them, only heightening the amount of anti-Semitism one experienced
### Medevil Anti-Semitism
The Jews had been denied citizenship, dined working in the Government and the Military and excluded from membership in guilds and the professions. There was  violence against them which lead to massacres in Worms, Trier - all because they had heard a rumor that the Jews had used the [[Blood]] of Christian Babies for Passover. Furthermore, they were accused of murdering William of Norwich - a child at the time, for using ritual magic and the boy as a host. This was the explanation that arouse when the boy had Inexplicably died. 

### Anti-Semitism during the Nazi Regime
The [[Nazi Party]] had orchestrated the "final solution", and it had wiped out 60% of the Jews that lived in Europe. They were still believed to be "money stealers". Hitler had also blamed the Jewish people for losing [[Major Events around the Globe|World War |]]. This worked was because the people wanted someone to pin the blame on
