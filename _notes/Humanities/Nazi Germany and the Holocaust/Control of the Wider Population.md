[[Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]
# Control of the Wider Population
The Nazi's had to many opponents in the general public, and they had to be silenced before they started to cause trouble. The Nazi Party had achieved this through two means, the SS and the Gestapo.
### Gestapo
- The Gestapo were the **state secret police** who gathered intelligence on people living in Germany. They had the power to tap phones, search mail and raid properties without permission from the courts. The Gestapo had the **powers to arrest and put people in prison without trial.**
- The Gestapo used a **network of informers** to get information on anyone who might oppose the Nazis.
- The Gestapo had over **150,000 informants** throughout the country who would report any anti-Nazi sentiment to the Gestapo. The Gestapo and their informants did not wear uniforms and, therefore, Germans did not know when they were being spied on. This created* tension and fear throughout the people*. The people were often **violently questioned** before being released or imprisoned.
### The SS
- ‘Schutz Staffel’ run by Heinrich Himmler. Originally this organization was set up as Hitler’s personal bodyguard. *They were totally loyal to Hitler.*
- By **1929** there were** 240,000** members of the SS. Members had to be Aryan (blond hair, blue eyed and physically fit). They had the powers to arrest and imprison people without trial.
- Two important sub-divisions of the SS were the Death’s Head units and the Waffen-SS.
	- The **Death’s Head units** were responsible for the [[Concentration Camp]] and the *murder of the Jews and other prisoners in the extermination camps.*
	- The **Waffen-SS** were special SS armored regiments which *fought alongside the regular army*.
### Heinrich Himmler
- He was the head of the SS and the police, including the Gestapo.
- Was obsessed with racial purity in Germany and encouraged Aryans into "breeding programs."
- In **1941** he established the Death Head Squads to eliminate all Jews in death camps.
