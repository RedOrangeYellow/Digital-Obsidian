[[Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]
# Perpetrators, Collaborators, Bystanders, Rescuers, and Resistors
### Perpetrators
Perpetrators are the people who ordered, organized, or carried out a persecution/killing. These held the [[Nazi Party]]'s [[Ideology and Beliefs]] on the decision to murder was to eliminate the enemy, any Jew or political enemy. This idea comes from the fact that Hitler wanted to maintain **absolute control** in Germany and German-occupied territory, as his title Fuhrer suggests.
### Collaborators
A collaborator is any person who supported the Nazis, by helping make the killings possible. These people are active supporters or helpers of the Nazi's. They **sell harmful substance**, that can be used to kill anyone, especially after knowing that the substance you were selling was used for malicious intent. Or they are **following orders from a person** with a higher rank than you, and not doing any actions to prevent yourself and/or others around you, even if you know that the course of action is immoral.
### Bystanders
Any person who knows about or sees an act that is morally bad, yet they don’t intervene. These people are passive supporters for the Nazi's, as they arn't doing to prevent it.
### Rescuers           
Any person who helped save the Jews, and other minority groups from persecution from the Nazi's. They usually **give them food, water, and clothes, so they can survive.** They are **passively resisting** the Nazi's "total" control over Germany, and German-occupied territory.
### Resistors
           
These people are people who **actively resisted** against the Nazi's. They don’t help victims, but they **fight against the Nazi's**. They go against orders, such as the youth opposition groups.
