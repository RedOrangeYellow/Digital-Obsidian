[[Hitler's Rise to Power]]
# Major Events around the Globe
### World War |
The world war was a war fought between the allies **([[Great Britain]],  France, Soviet Union)** and the axis powers **(Germany, Austria, Japan).** This war ended on the **11 November 1918** with Germany surrendering and accepting the **Treaty of Versailles**. This had infuriated the young Hitler, seeing his country that he loved becoming so weak. This event also saw *Hitler blame the Jews* for conspiring against them and "back-stabbing". 

### Great Depression
The Great Depression (also known as the Wall Street Crash) had seen the world fall apart, currency wise. This had occurred in the autumn of 1929. This had effected Germany's economy as the US recalled most of its loans to Germany. This had caused **unemployment** and **poverty** rates to soar, and lead to many Germans becoming desperate. Hitler had been able to take advantage of the public, which lead to the destruction of the German Democracy as Hitler positioned himself at the top.
