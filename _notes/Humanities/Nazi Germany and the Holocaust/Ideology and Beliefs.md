[[Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]
# Ideology and Beliefs
The [[Nazi Party]] had many beliefs. Having the power to do so because of the [[Enabling Act]], they had managed to commit atrocities against many. They had wanted to recreate a world of their vision. Their vision was the following:
- They had believed all Germans were part of the "Aryan Race", and all other races were inferior. There was a strong belief in eugenics.
- They also wanted more Lebensraum, which was the idea that Germans should have more living space and expand into other territories. They should reclaim their former territories lost because of  the [[Major Events around the Globe]].
- Furthermore, the party had valued family as important. They had wanted more soldiers for the inevitable war to come, so they came to the conclusion that a woman's role was to stay at home. *Kinder, Kirche, Kuche*, meaning *children, church, kitchen*, was a common phrase heard from wives.
