# Assassination Attempts Taken On Hitler
### Common Problems that Plotters Faced
           
- Hitler had frequently warned those in his inner circle that they all faced the problem of assassination attempts.
- Hitler took great steps to prevent such attempts. No-one knew in advance his movements, whether it was by car, train, or plane.
- Increasingly after 1940, he locked himself away in either the Chancellery in Berlin or his mountain home in Berchtesgaden.
- Simply getting near to Hitler would have been very difficult and security around him when he did venture into the public arena was very tight.
- Hitler also did not allow anyone near him to carry a weapon. Therefore, any attempt on his life would have had to be meticulously planned.
### Operation Valkyrie
**Key Information**
 - The assassination attempt was led by **Claus von Stauffenberg**, a decorated war-solider who was severely injured in **North Africa**, where he was wounded from gunfire from an enemy plane.
- Earlier attempts from other army officers failed because Hitler kept closing opportunities, such as deciding to not go to an opening of a museum.
- It took place on **20 July 1944**, **Rastenburg, Poland.**
- The bomb had a ten-minute fuse time before it blew.
- There was a **change in venue**, so the bomb had **less of an impact**.
- There was a pre-arranged phone call to get Stauffenberg out of the room before it the bomb went off.
- When Stauffenberg left, an officer moved the briefcase to the other side of the room, so it wasn't next to Hitler, but under a large, heavy, wooden leg of the map table.

**Timeline**
1. Stauffenberg promoted to full colonel and made the Chief-of-Staff to General Fromm. It made meetings that were led by Hitler a necessity to attend.
2. Change of venue and time. The bomb was no longer detonating inside a bunker, but in a meaning that the blasts would ricochet less, lowering the chance of success.
3. He left the meeting room moments before the bomb exploded, using the excuse that he had a phone call from someone in Berlin. After he left, an officer attending the briefing had moved the briefcase to the other side of the table support chosen by Stauffenberg as the ideal place to put the bomb.
4. The bomb exploded, but the blast was directed away from Hitler who survived with his clothes singed, a cut to his hand and damaged ear drums.
5. The conspirators, including Stauffenberg, based in the War Office were rounded up, and met their deaths by the firing squad.
