[[Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]
# Liberation
### Who were the liberated?
Jewish prisoners were evacuated from the [[Concentration Camp]] and forced on a death march. They were forced in cattle trucks or on foot to camps in the interior of the Reich, which were more secure and hidden. The consequences are deaths caused on the journey from the harsh winter, and deaths caused by overcrowded camps from diseases and starvation. People also died by being too sick to be freed.
           
Those that survived the ordeals above is considered liberated and a Holocaust survivor.
### Who were the Liberators and their challenges?
The soldiers of Allied armies: mainly Soviet, American, and British but also Canadian, French, and other nationalities. Not just soldiers but also doctors and nurses, relief workers, priests, and rabbis.

Some challenges they faced where that they had found this to be a highly traumatic experience. Although these men and women, who were often young themselves, had been exposed to the horrors of war, most testimonies show that they were not prepared for what confronted them when they reached camps such as Bergen-Belsen or Buchenwald.
Another Challenge they faced was while the horrors that they witnessed generally reinforced their conviction that they were fighting a just war, they also often left deep psychological scars at a time when post-traumatic stress was not fully understood or treated.

The liberators, like the survivors, were often left to recover from the traumatic experience by themselves, which took entire lives to recover from.
