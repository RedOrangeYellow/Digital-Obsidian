[[Control of the Wider Population]]
# Concentration Camps
Concentration Camps were used by the Nazi's as a mean of [[Control of the Wider Population]]. During the first six years of the Nazi Regime, concentration camps had been in high order, with* thousands murdered and more detained and confined for labor*. Prisoners did not have to face the judicial system. The prisoners are not convicted of crimes before detained and removed from society. This allowed all opponents and future opponents to be *taken down* without trouble. Furthermore, the concentration camps that were built during the 1930's were used as a way to intimidate other **political leaders**,** influencer's**, and stop **social and cultural movements**.

### The First Camp
The [[Nazi Party]] had established the first concentration camp, Dacha, on March the 23rd, 1933. This camp was used to imprison political opponents. It was later used as a foundation for an expanded and centralized concentration camp system by the SS.
