[[Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]
# Youth Opposition 
There were many that did not take the Nazi [[Ideology and Beliefs]] easily. They had refused to give in, and formed different groups to help and resist the [[Nazi Party]].

### White Rose
**Key Members**
Sophie Scholl **(Co-leader)**
Hans Scholl **(Co-leader)**
Christoph Probst **(Co-leader)**

**Outline**
This group started in **1941** by students at the **University of Munich** and they were triggered by the war. Most of them had been loyal Germans before the war and many of them had served in the German Army during the war and hated the atrocities it brought. For example, one member, **Hans Scholl** had seen Jews murdered in Poland. This group believed in opposing the Nazis by peaceful means. They began by mailing **leaflets** anonymously to people all over Germany. The leaflets called for *democracy and social justice.* They also painted messages on walls. By 1943 they began to leave leaflets in public places. In **February 1943** Hans and Sophie Scholl were seen and reported to the Gestapo. They were tried and **executed and within weeks**, 8*0 others were arrested and many executed*. Hans Scholl’s last words were *‘long live freedom!’*

**Methods used**
- Spreading their ideas about Nazi Germany through anonymously dropping information pamphlets that expressed their ideas. 
- Their protesting methods were all non-violent.

### Edelweiss Pirates
**Key Members**
Günther Schwarz **(Co-leader)**
Gustav Bermel **(Co-leader)**
Johann Müller **(Co-leader)**

**Outline**
This group rebelled against Hitler’s youth groups and by **1939 there were about 2000.** They rebelled by girls mixing with boys, they listened to modern ‘swing’ music, the boys grew their hair long, they wrote **anti-Nazi slogans** on walls and they **beat up members of the Hitler Youth**. After the war broke out members became more political. They *supported the Allies*; they helped army deserters or gave out Allied leaflets dropped from planes. At first, the Nazis did little as this group seemed to be no real danger to the regime. Young people were often arrested, their hair shaved off and released. However, as the war started to go badly after 1942 the group became more daring. They smashed factory equipment to disrupt war production and started to steal guns and explosives. In 1944 Himmler ordered a crackdown and hundreds of members were arrested. In Cologne 13 members were blamed for the death of a local Gestapo chief and were arrested and publicly hanged.

**Methods Used**
- Listened to swing music.
- Boys grew long hair.
- Wrote anti-Nazi slogans on walls.
- Beat up members of the Hitler Youth.
- Helped army deserted, gave out the alias pamphlets.
- Smashed factory equipment and stole guns and explosives.
