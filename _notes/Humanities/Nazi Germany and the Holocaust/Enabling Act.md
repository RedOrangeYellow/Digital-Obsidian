[[Hitler's Rise to Power]]
# Enabling Act
The Enabling Act allowed the Reich Government to issue laws without the consent of Germany's Parliament. This law was passed on March the 23rd, 1933, and published the following day. 

Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]] used intimidation to ensure the passing of the law. They had managed to prevent all 81 communist parties and 26 of the 120 Social Democrate'S from taking their seats by containing them in Nazi Controlled Camps.
