[[Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]
# Education in Nazi Germany
*The [[Nazi Party]] had vigorously changed the education material and subjects to their liking.*
- German Studies
	- Only German was taught no other foreign languages were used.
	- This was to highlight the importance of the master race.
- Geography
	- What land was rightfully German's, but had been lost during the [[Major Events around the Globe]], and to preach the [[Ideology and Beliefs]] of Lebensraum (idea of expansion for living space).
	- This had encouraged the students to support the need for war in the near future.
- History
	- Students were taught of Germany's **glorious past** in hopes that they would want to reclaim that lost glory. They were further taught that the *Jews had "stabbed" Germans in the back during World War |*.
	- This was to teach **Germany's hatred towards other countries** and help with when the start of war ignited. This also created **nationalist beliefs** in the youngsters.
- Music
	- National/Nazi Party Songs.
	- Used as a means of further **propaganda** for the party.
- Race Studies
	- Biology was used to "prove" that the Aryan race was superior. This was drawn from a book called *On the Origin of Species* by **Charles Darwin**, released on the **24th of November, 1859**
	- This cultured the belief int he master race and spread anti-Semitism.
- Party Beliefs
	- [[Nazi Party]]'s [[Ideology and Beliefs]] was taught, and the aims for Germany in the near future that this generation was going to take part in.
	- This was to indoctrinate the students.
- Domestic Science (Only taught to the girls)
	- They learnt how to become the "perfect" **wife** and mother for an **Aryan household.**
	- This was to urge them to* give more children* to the German Country for solider training.
